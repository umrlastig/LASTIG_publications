	abstract = {Iconographic image collections are a cultural heritage that could reach a larger audience by proposing their immersive presentation in a 3D web application. Proposing a historical street view application, based on these historical images, raises issues such as the unavailability of historical 3D models of the scene and the heterogeneity and sparsity of these photographs. We propose to use the 3D city and terrain models of the current scene, as well as a 3D point cloud if available, to simultaneously reproject and blend many historical images using an image-based rendering approach. Our contributions raise significantly the number of projective textures blended per rendering pass (typically from 8 to 40) on triangular meshes (of the 3D city and terrain models) and on point clouds. As a first step to tackle diachrony artifacts, we also propose a simple point cloud classification to filter in the shader the points corresponding to building or terrain details from the points corresponding to transient objects.  © 2022 Copernicus GmbH.

This study explores the potential of this imagery for glacier mapping and change estimation. We assess KH-9PC imagery using data from the KH-9 mapping camera (KH-9MC), KH-4PC, and SPOT and Pléiades satellite imagery. The high resolution of KH-9PC leads to higher-quality DEMs, which better resolve the accumulation region of the glaciers in comparison to the KH-9MC. On stable terrain, KH-9PC DEMs achieve an elevation accuracy of <4gm with respect to SPOT and Pléiades DEMs. While the estimated geodetic mass balances using PC and MC data are similar after outlier filtering, the elevation change data show superior spatial coverage and considerably less noise when using KH-9PC data.  © 2023 The Author(s).},

This paper presents a new method for assessing city visibility using a 3D model on a metropolitan scale. This method measures the view composition in terms of city objects visible from a given viewpoint and produces a georeferenced and semantically rich database of those visible objects in order to propose a thematic vision of the city and its urban landscape. As far as computational efficiency is concerned and considering the large amount of data needed, the method relies on a dedicated system of automatic data organization for analyzing visibility over vast areas (hundreds of square kilometers), offering various possibilities for uses on different scales. In terms of operational uses, as shown in our paper, the various results produced by the method (quantitative data, georeferenced databases and 3D schematic images) allow for a wide spectrum of applications in urban planning. © 2022 by the authors.},

They inform the other foragers by performing specific dance sequences according to the spatial characteristics of the resource. The purpose of our study is to provide a new tool for honeybees dances recording, usable in the field, in a practical and fully automated way, without condemning the harvest of honey. We designed and equipped an outdoor prototype of a production hive, later called “GeoDanceHive”, allowing the continuous recording of honeybees’ behavior such as dances and their analysis. The GeoDanceHive is divided into two sections, one for the colony and the other serving as a recording studio. The time record of dances can be set up from minutes to several months. To validate the encoding and sampling quality, we used an artificial feeder and visual decoding to generate maps with the vector endpoints deduced from the dance information. The use of the GeoDanceHive is designed for a wide range of users, who can meet different objectives, such as researchers or professional beekeepers. Thus, our hive is a powerful tool for honeybees studies in the field and could highly contribute to facilitating new research approaches and a better understanding landscape ecology of key pollinators. © 2023 by the authors.},

The inclusion of these emerging methods in the daily monitoring of the activities of a heritage restoration site (context in which hundreds of photographs per day can be acquired by multiple actors, in accordance with several observation and analysis needs) raises new questions at the intersection of big data management, analysis, semantic enrichment, and more generally automatic structuring of this data. In this article we propose a data model developed around these questions and identify the main challenges to overcome the problem of structuring massive collections of photographs through a review of the available literature on similarity metrics used to organise the pictures based on their content or metadata.

	abstract = {Graphical models and factor analysis are well-established tools in multivariate statistics. While these models can be both linked to structures exhibited by covariance and precision matrices, they are generally not jointly leveraged within graph learning processes. This paper therefore addresses this issue by proposing a flexible algorithmic framework for graph learning under low-rank structural constraints on the covariance matrix. The problem is expressed as penalized maximum likelihood estimation of an elliptical distribution (a generalization of Gaussian graphical models to possibly heavy-tailed distributions), where the covariance matrix is optionally constrained to be structured as low-rank plus diagonal (low-rank factor model). The resolution of this class of problems is then tackled with Riemannian optimization, where we leverage geometries of positive definite matrices and positive semi-definite matrices of fixed rank that are well suited to elliptical models. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

These models learn pixel-level matching with a contrastive loss and are agnostic to the geometry of the considered scene. We establish a middle ground between hybrid and end-to-end approaches by learning to densely allocate all corresponding pixels of an epipolar pair at once. Our features are learnt on large image tiles to be expressive and capture the scene's wider context. We also demonstrate that curated sample mining can enhance the overall robustness of the predicted similarities and improve the performance on radiometri-cally homogeneous areas. We run experiments on aerial and satellite datasets. Our DeepSim-Nets outperform the baseline hybrid approaches and generalize better to unseen scene geometries than end-to-end methods. Our flexible architecture can be readily adopted in standard multi-resolution image matching pipelines. The code is available at https://github.com/DaliCHEBBI/DeepSimNets. © 2023 IEEE.},

Digital terrain models (DTMs) obtained over three sites in the Amazon region (French Guiana and North Brazil) are evaluated according to two types of quality criteria: on the one hand, the accuracy of elevations and slopes, calculated by comparison with lidar surveys used as reference data; on the other hand, the hydrographic coherence of the DTM, revealed by its compliance to some universal rules like "all rivers flow downhill", or the fact that landforms shaped by water have a fractal behaviour. The results depend on the scale, the effect of which is addressed.

	abstract = {Satellite radar backscatter contains unique information on land surface moisture, vegetation features, and surface roughness and has thus been used in a range of Earth science disciplines. However, there is no single global radar data set that has a relatively long wavelength and a decades-long time span. We here provide the first long-term (since 1992), high-resolution (ĝ1/48.9km instead of the commonly used ĝ1/425km resolution) monthly satellite radar backscatter data set over global land areas, called the long-term, high-resolution scatterometer (LHScat) data set, by fusing signals from the European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS; 1992-2001; C-band; 5.3GHz), Quick Scatterometer (QSCAT, 1999-2009; Ku-band; 13.4GHz), and the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT; since 2007; C-band; 5.255GHz). The 6-year data gap between C-band ERS and ASCAT was filled by modelling a substitute C-band signal during 1999-2009 from Ku-band QSCAT signals and climatic information. To this end, we first rescaled the signals from different sensors, pixel by pixel. We then corrected the monthly signal differences between the C-band and the scaled Ku-band signals by modelling the signal differences from climatic variables (i.e. monthly precipitation, skin temperature, and snow depth) using decision tree regression. The quality of the merged radar signal was assessed by computing the Pearson r, root mean square error (RMSE), and relative RMSE (rRMSE) between the C-band and the corrected Ku-band signals in the overlapping years (1999-2001 and 2007-2009). We obtained high Pearson r values and low RMSE values at both the regional (r≥0.92, RMSE≤0.11dB, and rRMSE≤0.38) and pixel levels (median r across pixels≥0.64, median RMSE≤0.34dB, and median rRMSE≤0.88), suggesting high accuracy for the data-merging procedure. The merged radar signals were then validated against the European Space Agency (ESA) ERS-2 data, which provide observations for a subset of global pixels until 2011, even after the failure of on-board gyroscopes in 2001. We found highly concordant monthly dynamics between the merged radar signals and the ESA ERS-2 signals, with regional Pearson r values ranging from 0.79 to 0.98. These results showed that our merged radar data have a consistent C-band signal dynamic. The LHScat data set (10.6084/m9.figshare.20407857; Tao et al., 2023) is expected to advance our understanding of the long-term changes in, e.g., global vegetation and soil moisture with a high spatial resolution. The data set will be updated on a regular basis to include the latest images acquired by ASCAT and to include even higher spatial and temporal resolutions.  © Copyright: },

Deep Learning (DL)-based methods have shown effectiveness in the special case of epipolar stereo disparity estimation in the computer vision community. DL-based methods depend heavily on the quality and quantity of training datasets. However, generating ground-truth disparity maps for real scenes remains a challenging task in the photogrammetry community. To address this challenge, we propose a method for generating ground-truth disparity maps directly from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and images to produce a large and diverse dataset for six aerial datasets across four different areas and two areas with different resolution images. We also introduce a LiDAR-to-image co-registration refinement to the framework that takes special precautions regarding occlusions and refrains from disparity interpolation to avoid precision loss. Evaluating 11 dense matching methods across datasets with diverse scene types, image resolutions, and geometric configurations, which are deeply investigated in dataset shift, GANet performs best with identical training and testing data, and PSMNet shows robustness across different datasets, and we proposed the best strategy for training with a limit dataset. We will also provide the dataset and training models; more information can be found at https://github.com/whuwuteng/Aerial_Stereo_Dataset. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Historical visual sources are particularly useful for reconstructing the successive states of the territory in the past and for analysing its evolution. However, finding visual sources covering a given area within a large mass of archives can be very difficult if they are poorly documented. In the case of aerial photographs, most of the time, this task is carried out by solely relying on the visual content of the images. Convolutional Neural Networks are capable to capture the visual cues of the images and match them to each other given a sufficient amount of training data. However, over time and across seasons, the natural and man-made landscapes may evolve, making historical image-based retrieval a challenging task. We want to approach this cross-time aerial indexing and retrieval problem from a different novel point of view: by using geometrical and topological properties of geographic entities of the researched zone encoded as graph representations which are more robust to appearance changes than the pure image-based ones. Geographic entities in the vertical aerial images are thought of as nodes in a graph, linked to each other by edges representing their spatial relationships. To build such graphs, we propose to use instances from topographic vector databases and state-of-the-art spatial analysis methods. We demonstrate how these geospatial graphs can be successfully matched across time by means of the learned graph embedding. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The civil security sirens are used by the authorities in a wide range of countries to signal an imminent or ongoing threat. Even if their sound level is known, it is nevertheless difficult to evaluate their audibility across a given zone, especially in complex urban environments. An experimental protocol was deployed around a siren installed in a town in France, to assess its audibility perceptually and through modeling. Sound level measurements during source activation were made with the NoiseCapture smartphone application at different distances and on several axes by a group of 25 participants. They were also asked to fill in a questionnaire on perceptual information about the siren such as its audibility, the perceived sound level, or the masking of the siren by passing vehicles. A comparison between acoustic measurement levels using NoiseCapture and simulated sound levels using NoiseModelling was performed. The results of this study validate the use of the Common Noise Assessment Methods in Europe model to evaluate the audibility of a warning system located in an urban environment within a radius of 2.8 km around the siren. Finally, a metric linking audibility to modeled sound level is proposed, enabling the development of siren audibility maps in the study area.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.},

	abstract = {The automation of map generalization has been an important research subject for decades but is not fully solved yet. Deep learning techniques are designed for various image generation tasks, so one may think that it would be possible to apply these techniques to cartography and train a holistic model for end-to-end map generalization. On the contrary, we assume that map generalization is a task too complex to be learnt with a unique model. Thus, in this article, we propose to resort to past research on map generalization and to separate map generalization into simpler sub-tasks, each of which can be more easily resolved by a deep neural network. Our main contribution is a workflow of deep models, called DeepMapScaler, which achieves a step-by-step topographic map generalization from detailed topographic data. First, we implement this workflow to generalize topographic maps containing roads, buildings, and rivers at a medium scale (1:50k) from a detailed dataset. The results of each step are quantitatively and visually evaluated. Then the generalized images are compared with the generalization performed using a holistic model for an end-to-end map generalization and a traditional semi-automatic map generalization process. The experiment shows that the workflow approach is more promising than the holistic model, as each sub-task is specialized and fine-tuned accordingly. However, the results still do not reach the quality level of the semi-automatic traditional map generalization process, as some sub-tasks are more complex to handle with neural networks. © 2023 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.},

	abstract = {Bundle adjustment (BA) is the standard way to optimise camera poses and to produce sparse representations of a scene. However, as the number of camera poses and features grows, refinement through bundle adjustment becomes inefficient. Inspired by global motion averaging methods, we propose a new bundle adjustment objective which does not rely on image features' reprojection errors yet maintains precision on par with classical BA. Our method averages over relative motions while implicitly incorporating the contribution of the structure in the adjustment. To that end, we weight the objective function by local hessian matrices - a by-product of local bundle adjustments performed on relative motions (e.g., pairs or triplets) during the pose initialisation step. Such hessians are extremely rich as they encapsulate both the features' random errors and the geometric configuration between the cameras. These pieces of information propagated to the global frame help to guide the final optimisation in a more rigorous way. We argue that this approach is an upgraded version of the motion averaging approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on both photogrammetric datasets and computer vision benchmarks.

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that radar temporal coherence over tropical and boreal forests undergoes a diurnal cycle as a result of a combined effect of the wind-induced motion of scatterers and of the change and displacement of water within the plant in response to the transpiration process. Within this context, the objective of this paper is to investigate, for the first time, the diurnal cycle of temporal coherence over wheat crops in relation to its development and physiological functioning throughout the agricultural season. A ground-based experiment was installed in Morocco, targeting a wheat field during the 2020 agricultural season. The radar system, essentially based on a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) connected to 6C-band antennas installed at the top of a 20 m tower, has enabled quad-polarimetric acquisitions every 15 min. In parallel, evapotranspiration, soil moisture and meteorological variables are automatically measured in addition to above-ground biomass and vegetation water content collected during field campaigns. The results show that the temporal coherence with a 15 min baseline follows a marked diurnal cycle characterized by variable amplitude according to the phenological stage, with high values during the night, a significant morning drop to reach the lowest values in the late afternoon followed by an increase to recover the high nighttime values. The rate of the drop at dawn is shown to be related to the increase of evapotranspiration (r = 0.80 at VV polarization) when the wheat is covering the soil and the transpiration dominate the evapotranspiration process. This supports the assumption of a physiological effect related to water movement entailing a decorrelation. By contrast, the daily minimum of temporal coherence occurring in the late afternoon correlates well to the daily maximum of wind (r = 0.7). Interestingly enough, the amplitude of the diurnal cycle exhibit a marked seasonal evolution characterized by an increase of 85% from tillering to maturity in relation to the wheat development. At the early start of the season when the soil is almost bare, irrigation events impact slightly the diurnal cycle of temporal coherence. Likewise, it is shown that the presence of dew in the early morning has led to a decrease of the decorrelation rate. Temporal coherence dynamic has also been investigated for longer baselines up to 22 days. Results indicate a stronger decorrelation than what has been observed on tropical and boreal forests by previous studies with values below 0.4 for baselines above 2 days. Taken together, the results of this work demonstrate the unique potential of sub-daily C-band data for monitoring crop water status by future geostationary radar missions such as Hydroterra. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {(1) Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is highly associated with various somatic conditions that can be masked by the core symptoms of ASD and thus complicate the diagnosis. Identifying co-occurring somatic disorders is critical for providing effective healthcare and social services for ASD populations and influences their long-term outcomes. A systematic assessment of co-occurring somatic conditions is essential during this ASD diagnostic process. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the organization and content of the initial somatic assessment (ISA). (2) Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the ASD diagnostic process published between January 2005 and December 2019 in English and French and performed an appraisal following the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation, second edition (AGREE-II). (3) Results: We selected 14 CPGs that were heterogeneous in quality, with methodological scores between 32.3 and 91.9. Clinical examinations are the first step in the ISA, and the participation of pediatric, neuropediatric, and genetic specialists was highly recommended by the majority of the CPGs. The recommendations included hearing screening tests (10/14), visual examinations (8/14), and systematic genetic investigations (4/14). The CPGs also described additional investigations that should be conducted based on numerous warning signs. (4) Conclusions: Screening for consensual international warning signs is necessary to perform a comprehensive and systematic ISA during the ASD diagnostic process. A “referral form” could be used to guide clinicians and improve the coordination process. This tool may reinforce epidemiological data on co-occurring somatic disorders in patients with ASD. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Crop type identification is critical for agricultural sustainability policy development and environmental assessments. Therefore, it is important to obtain their spatial distribution via different approaches. Medium-, high- and very high-resolution optical satellite sensors are efficient tools for acquiring this information, particularly for challenging studies such as those conducted in heterogeneous agricultural fields. This research examined the ability of four multitemporal datasets (Sentinel-1-SAR (S1), Sentinel-2-MSI (S2), RapidEye (RE), and PlanetScope (PS)) to identify land cover and crop types (LCCT) in a Mediterranean irrigated area. To map LCCT distribution, a supervised pixel-based classification is adopted using Support Vector Machine with a radial basis function kernel (SVMRB) and Random Forest (RF). Thus, LCCT maps were generated into three levels, including six (Level I), ten (Level II), and fourteen (Level III) classes. Overall, the findings revealed high overall accuracies of >92%, >83%, and > 81% for Level I, Level II, and Level III, respectively, except for Sentinel-1. It was found that accuracy improves considerably when the number of classes decreases, especially when cropland or non-cropland classes are grouped into one. Furthermore, there was a similarity in performance between S2 alone and S1S2. PlanetScope LCCT classifications outperform other sensors. In addition, the present study demonstrated that SVM achieved better performances against RF and can thereby effectively extract LCCT information from high-resolution imagery as PlanetScope. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

While underwater self-calibration gives good results when coupled with multi-view algorithms, calibration or pre-calibration with a pattern is still necessary when scenes are weakly textured or if there are not enough points of view of the same points; however, detecting patterns on underwater images or obtaining a good distribution of these patterns on a dataset is not an easy task. Thus, we propose a methodology to guide the acquisition of a relevant underwater calibration dataset. This process is intended to provide feedback in near real-time to the operator to guide the acquisition and stop it when a sufficient number of relevant calibration images have been reached. To perform this, pattern detection must be optimized both in time and success rate. We propose three variations of optimized detection algorithms, each of which takes into account different hardware capabilities.

	abstract = {Agent-based models have been developed and widely employed to assess the impact of disturbances or conservation management on animal habitat use, population development, and viability. However, the direct impacts of canopy disturbance on the arboreal movement of individual primates have been less studied. Such impacts could shed light on the cascading effects of disturbances on animal health and fitness. Orangutans are an arboreal primate that commonly encounters habitat quality deterioration due to land-use changes and related disturbances such as forest fires. Forest disturbance may, therefore, create a complex stress scenario threatening orangutan populations. Due to forest disturbances, orangutans may adapt to employ more terrestrial, as opposed to arboreal, movements potentially prolonging the search for fruiting and nesting trees. In turn, this may lead to changes in daily activity patterns (i.e., time spent traveling, feeding, and resting) and available energy budget, potentially decreasing the orangutan's fitness. We developed the agent-based simulation model BORNEO (arBOReal aNimal movEment mOdel), which explicitly describes both orangutans' arboreal and terrestrial movement in a forest habitat, depending on distances between trees and canopy structures. Orangutans in the model perform activities with a motivation to balance energy intake and expenditure through locomotion. We tested the model using forest inventory data obtained in Sebangau National Park, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. This allowed us to construct virtual forests with real characteristics including tree connectivity, thus creating the potential to expand the environmental settings for simulation experiments. In order to parameterize the energy related processes of the orangutans described in the model, we applied a computationally intensive evolutionary algorithm and evaluated the simulation results against observed behavioral patterns of orangutans. Both the simulated variability and proportion of activity budgets including feeding, resting, and traveling time for female and male orangutans confirmed the suitability of the model for its purpose. We used the calibrated model to compare the activity patterns and energy budgets of orangutans in both natural and disturbed forests. The results confirm field observations that orangutans in the disturbed forest are more likely to experience deficit energy balance due to traveling to the detriment of feeding time. Such imbalance is more pronounced in males than in females. The finding of a threshold of forest disturbances that affects a significant change in activity and energy budgets suggests potential threats to the orangutan population. Our study introduces the first agent-based model describing the arboreal movement of primates that can serve as a tool to investigate the direct impact of forest changes and disturbances on the behavior of species such as orangutans. Moreover, it demonstrates the suitability of high-performance computing to optimize the calibration of complex agent-based models describing animal behavior at a fine spatio-temporal scale (1-m and 1-s granularity).

When observed at the scale of systems of cities, such concern is considered as a series of innovations that challenges the adaptive capacity of urban systems. The spatial complexity, the non-optimal nature of such systems, and the multi-objective aspects of their agents, are among the reasons that raise difficulties when trying to adjust local policies through promoting innovation in order to satisfy at least a couple of SDGs simultaneously. As we lack enough empirical evidence, we propose in this paper to use a stylised simulation model for systems of cities, focused on innovation diffusion and population dynamics, to show how trade-offs may operate at such a scale. We proceed in particular to a bi-objective optimisation of emissions and innovation utilities, and show that no single urban optimum exists, but a diversity of regimes forming a compromise between the two objectives. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {High resolution satellite images with improved spatial and temporal resolution provide unprecedented opportunities to monitor Earth Surface changes in 2D and 3D due, for example, to earthquakes, sand dune migration, ice flow, or landslides. The volume of imagery available for such measurements is rapidly growing but the exploitation of these data is challenging due to the various sources of geometric distortions of the satellite imagery. Here we propose a new approach to extract high-quality surface displacement in 3D based on the correlation of multi-date and multi-platform high resolution optical imagery. We additionally show that when a large enough volume of data is available, it is possible to separate the deformation signal from the artifacts due to the satellite jitter and misalignment of the CCDs, which, together with topographic artifacts, are the main source of noise in the measurements. Our method makes use of a reference DEM, but the outcome is independent of the characteristics of the chosen DEM. We use the case-example of the ground deformation caused by the Ridgecrest earthquake sequence to assess the performance of our proposed approach. We show that it outperforms the more standard approach which combines 2-D correlation and DEM differencing. With our technique, we were able to generate high quality measurements of coseismic ground displacement with GSD of 2.4 m, and uncertainties at the 90% confidence level on the NS, EW and vertical displacement measurements of 0.6 m, 0.7 m, and 0.6 m respectively. © 2022},

To make the exploration of these multi-scale maps more fluid, one option is to design maps where the transformations due to scale change are more progressive. This paper proposes to use cartographic generalization techniques to design these multi-scale maps with additional intermediate scales to improve progressiveness. These more progressive maps are tested in a user study with a task requiring multiple zooms in and out. The users perform better with the progressive maps, and in particular, the total quantity of required zooming is reduced compared to maps without additional intermediate scales. However, the survey is not fully conclusive on task performance due to the complexity of such a survey with real maps. This difficulty in assessing how well progressive map generalisation reduces disorientation is discussed and guidelines are proposed to design further studies. © (2023), (University of Maine).

While tactile maps are an important support in both mobility training and independent journeys, the caseload of manual map production has made them less accessible. This paper explores the possibility of (semi-) automatically producing tactile maps for street intersections at large scales, with an initial evaluation focused on the graphic aspect of the produced maps. The automation attempts to identify acceptable default parameters and values and proposes an exploration of possible choices for potentially open decisions. It adapts the classic map production process with parameters to present the information tactilely at the intersection scale, and produces representation meaningful for PVIs and realistic for an automatic procedure, resulting in ready-to-print maps in two scales of three sizes, with different levels of details and styles. The resulting maps are evaluated by professionals involved in tactile graphics through a questionnaire to evaluate the defaults and discuss the possibility of open choices. The professionals validated the maps, and their evaluation emphasized the need to have an acceptable default while keeping some options open to cater to the diversity in the visually impaired audience. © 2024 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.},

However, to gain from this complementarity, these data sources must be precisely registered. In this paper, we propose a new primitive based registration algorithm that takes 3D segments as features. The objective of the proposed algorithm is to register heterogeneous data. The heterogeneity is both in data type (image and LiDAR) and acquisition platform (terrestrial and aerial). Our algorithm starts by extracting 3D segments from LiDAR and image data with state of the art algorithms. Then it clusters the 3D segments of each data according to their directions. The obtained clusters are associated to find possible rotations, then 3D segments from associated clusters are matched in order to find the translation and scale factor minimizing a distance criteria between the two sets of 3D segments. Two optimizers (simulated annealing and RANSAC) are tested to minimize this distance criterion, first on synthetic data, then on real data. The experiments carried out demonstrate the robustness and speed of RANSAC compared to simulated annealing.  © 2022 R. Djahel et al.},

To address this issue, we first introduce HelixNet, a 10 billion point dataset with fine-grained labels, timestamps, and sensor rotation information necessary to accurately assess the real-time readiness of segmentation algorithms. Second, we propose Helix4D, a compact and efficient spatio-temporal transformer architecture specifically designed for rotating LiDAR sequences. Helix4D operates on acquisition slices corresponding to a fraction of a full sensor rotation, significantly reducing the total latency. Helix4D reaches accuracy on par with the best segmentation algorithms on HelixNet and SemanticKITTI with a reduction of over 5 × in terms of latency and 50 × in model size.

	abstract = {CNES is currently carrying out a Phase A study to assess the feasibility of a future hyperspectral imaging sensor (10 m spatial resolution) combined with a panchromatic camera (2.5 m spatial resolution). This mission focuses on both high spatial and spectral resolution requirements, as inherited from previous French studies such as HYPEX, HYPXIM, and BIODIVERSITY. To meet user requirements, cost, and instrument compactness constraints, CNES asked the French hyperspectral Mission Advisory Group (MAG), representing a broad French scientific community, to provide recommendations on spectral sampling, particularly in the Short Wave InfraRed (SWIR) for various applications. This paper presents the tests carried out with the aim of defining the optimal spectral sampling and spectral resolution in the SWIR domain for quantitative estimation of physical variables and classification purposes. The targeted applications are geosciences (mineralogy, soil moisture content), forestry (tree species classification, leaf functional traits), coastal and inland waters (bathymetry, water column, bottom classification in shallow water, coastal habitat classification), urban areas (land cover), industrial plumes (aerosols, methane and carbon dioxide), cryosphere (specific surface area, equivalent black carbon concentration), and atmosphere (water vapor, carbon dioxide and aerosols). All the products simulated in this exercise used the same CNES end-to-end processing chain, with realistic instrument parameters, enabling easy comparison between applications. 648 simulations were carried out with different spectral strategies, radiometric calibration performances and signal-to-noise Ratios (SNR): 24 instrument configurations × 25 datasets (22 images + 3 spectral libraries). The results show that spectral sampling up to 20 nm in the SWIR range is sufficient for most applications. However, 10 nm spectral sampling is recommended for applications based on specific absorption bands such as mineralogy, industrial plumes or atmospheric gases. In addition, a slight performance loss is generally observed when radiometric calibration accuracy decreases, with a few exceptions in bathymetry and in the cryosphere for which the observed performance is severely degraded. Finally, most applications can be achieved with a realistic SNR, with the exception of bathymetry, shallow water classification, as well as carbon dioxide and methane estimation, which require the optimistic SNR level tested. On the basis of these results, CNES is currently evaluating the best compromise for designing the future hyperspectral sensor to meet the objectives of priority applications. © 2024},

Using automatic image retrieval methods appears to be the solution to bring structure by building links between contents, within and between collections. This paper presents an overview of methods for image retrieval applied to geographic iconographic heritage collections, both from the perspectives of image content description and of post-processing re-ranking. The article evaluates features and methods to identify their efficiency when faced with a challenging dataset. Moreover, new re-ranking approaches exploiting structuring information (scene geometry, metadata) are proposed to improve retrieval without having to adapt image descriptors to the specific data (retraining, fine-tuning, etc.) for every new specific collection. © 2023 ACM.},

We argue that such maps require a pan-scalar map design, which may differ significantly from established map design axioms and standards. This review is twofold. First, it reviews current practices in pan-scalar map design. Second, it summarizes and synthesizes literature about pan-scalar map design, as well as human-computer interaction (HCI) best practices for pan-scalar maps. The review of practices is based on a ScaleMaster analysis of the design of three popular pan-scalar maps: Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, and France's IGN Classic. Discussion centers on both stellar and subpar contemporary pan-scalar map design practices to help guide future practical pan-scalar designs and research on pan-scalar maps broadly. © 2023 International Cartographic Association.},

	abstract = {The use of digital models and tools to support a more sober, sustainable and human-centred spatial planning is constantly expanding. Among those, digital models of buildings and territories are considered useful by scientists and practitioners and used for a wide range of purposes. Several labels are currently used to characterise those digital tools and models, partly reflecting on technological developments: 3D city models, Planning support systems, Smart Cities, urbanism 3.0., City Information Model (CIM), Digital Twins (DT), etc. First used in industry, the label DT is now both used by practitioners and researchers, in relation to the development of innovative city models. Nevertheless, this label remains fuzzily defined and designates heterogeneous models from a technical standpoint. In this paper, we propose an exploration of the definitions and technical contents of DT at the city scale and a comparison with CIM approaches, as CIM is also used to label similar city models. Our analysis is based on a literature review of both DT and CIM definitions and applications to the urban context, an exploratory survey conducted with 13 practitioners about their views on DT and its potential regarding urban planning and management and a comparison of a few real-world projects either labelled CIM or DT by practitioners. Our analysis leads us to pinpoint several of the remaining challenges for a DT approach to be developed at the city scale. We also shed light on potential shortcomings of future research, if based on too narrow DT definitions.  © 2022 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Often enriched with semantic information, they carry different names and are technically very heterogeneous. In this article, we explore the scientific literature strongly developing around the City Information Model (CIM) concept and confront it with a feedback on a CIM approach deployed on a concerted development zone (ZAC). Our investigation is performed in collaboration with stakeholders and in the early phases of the ZAC, in order to explore the possible uses of the CIM of the project at the urban scale. The interviews focused on the technical and governance aspects of these models and on the exchanges between actors. We highlight the gap between the discussions on CIM and their implementation in a project involving many contributors. We therefore point out the complexity of the CIM definition, the necessity to precisely describe CIM uses and the operational difficulties of collaboration among actors. We identify research areas to be investigated so as to consolidate the theoretical and practical knowledge of digital urban models, such as empirical data collection and the needs of involved actors. © 2023 Cairn France.

This kind of registration is considered a challenging problem, especially when both data sets are acquired separately and use different types of sensors. Besides, comparing a BIM to as-built data is an important factor to perform building progress monitoring and quality control. To carry out this comparison, the data sets must be registered. In order to solve both registration problems, we introduce two efficient algorithms. The first offers a potential solution for indoor/outdoor registration based on heterogeneous features (openings and planes). The second is based on linear features and proposes a potential solution for LiDAR data/BIM model registration. The common point between the approaches consists in the definition of a global robust distance between two segment sets and the minimization of this distance based on the RANSAC paradigm, finding the rigid geometric transformation that is the most consistent with all the information in the data sets.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Here, some of the experiences and learnings gained from part of one such project, which aimed to further the role of citizen science within Earth observation and help address environmental challenges, LandSense, are shared. The key focus is on quality assurance of citizen generated data on land use and land cover especially to support analyses of remotely sensed data and products. Particular focus is directed to quality assurance checks on photographic image quality, privacy, polygon overlap, positional accuracy and offset, contributor agreement, and categorical accuracy.

The rapid development and multiplication of collaborative mapping tools and open data have led to the growth of the phenomenon of importing massive data into OSM. The goal of this paper is to study the evolution of the massive imports over time. We propose an approach in three steps: classification of the sources used to edit features in the OSM platform including those massively imported, classification of modifications, and identification of evolution patterns. The approach is mixing global analysis (i.e. sources and modifications are classified) and feature based analysis (i.e. imported features are analyzed with respect to their evolution over time). The approach is applied on three datasets coming from OSM considered for their heterogeneity in terms of complexity, imports, and spatial and temporal characteristics. The results show that there is a sustained activity of edition on imported features, with a ratio between geometry editions and semantic editions depending on the type of the features, with roads being the features concentrating the most activity.  © 2022 Copernicus GmbH.

	abstract = {Mobile sensors are increasingly used to monitor air quality to accurately quantify human exposure to air pollution. These sensors are subject to various issues (misuse, malfunctions, battery problems, etc) that are likely to cause data quality problems. These quality problems may have a considerable impact on the reliability of analytical studies. In this work, we address the problem of data quality evaluation and improvement in mobile crowd-sensing environments. Our work is focused on the data completeness quality dimension. We introduce a multi-dimensional model to represent the data coming from the sensors in this context, and then present the different facets of data completeness inspired by the model. We propose quality indicators capturing different facets of completeness along with their corresponding quality metrics. We also propose an approach to improve data completeness by extending two existing data imputation techniques, SVDImpute and KNNImpute, with information about the sensor quality. Our experiments show that our quality-aware imputation approach improves the accuracy of the imputation achieved by the original techniques. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Digital surface model generation using traditional multi-view stereo matching (MVS) performs poorly over non-Lambertian surfaces, with asynchronous acquisitions, or at discontinuities. Neural radiance fields (NeRF) offer a new paradigm for reconstructing surface geometries using continuous volumetric representation. NeRF is self-supervised, does not require ground truth geometry for training, and provides an elegant way to include in its representation physical parameters about the scene, thus potentially remedying the challenging scenarios where MVS fails. However, NeRF and its variants require many views to produce convincing scene's geometries which in earth observation satellite imaging is rare. In this paper we present SparseSat-NeRF (SpS-NeRF) - an extension of Sat-NeRF adapted to sparse satellite views. SpS-NeRF employs dense depth supervision guided by cross-correlation similarity metric provided by traditional semi-global MVS matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on stereo and tri-stereo Pléiades 1B/WorldView-3 images, and compare against NeRF and Sat-NeRF.

	abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) based on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) is an interesting solution to provide absolute positions at different locations of a structure in a global reference frame. In particular, low-cost GNSS stations for large-scale bridge monitoring have gained increasing attention these last years because recent experiments showed the ability to achieve a subcentimeter accuracy for continuous monitoring with adequate combinations of antennas and receivers. Technical solutions now allow displacement monitoring of long bridges with a cost-effective deployment of GNSS sensing networks. In particular, the redundancy of observations within the GNSS network with various levels of correlations between the GNSS time series makes such monitoring solution a good candidate for anomaly detection based on machine learning models, using several predictive models for each sensor (based on environmental conditions, or other sensors as input data). This strategy is investigated in this paper based on GNSS time series, and an anomaly indicator is proposed to detect and locate anomalous structural behavior. The proposed concepts are applied to a cable-stayed bridge for illustration, and the comparison between multiple tools highlights recurrent neural networks (RNN) as an effective regression tool. Coupling this tool with the proposed anomaly detection strategy enables one to identify and localize both real and simulated anomalies in the considered data set. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Maps and their usage have widely evolved recently, to become more and more interactive, multi-scale and accessible. However, the design of maps did not change so much, leading to the following two problems: (1) in theory, it is not formalised how to create a good map in this context, (2) in practice, the most used maps are not good considering the quality criteria defined for the classical (static) maps. Therefore, it is necessary to question the usefulness of these principles in this new context. In this article, we focus on the role of cartographic generalisation in maps where one can easily zoom in and out to make information accessible. We draw up a list of hypotheses on the role of generalisation for pan-scalar maps, based on both a deductive approach (the role of map generalisation is deduced from a review of human-maps interactions), and an inductive approach (observation of maps with diverse qualities). Then, we discuss how these hypotheses might be experimentally verified. © Azelle Courtial and Guillaume Touya.},

It is produced from a set of aerial images impaired by radiometric inhomogeneity mostly due to atmospheric phenomena, like hotspot, haze or high altitude clouds shadows as well as the camera itself, like lens vignetting. These create some unsightly radiometric inhomogeneity in the mosaic that could be corrected by using a local adaptive filter, also named Wallis filter. Yet this solution leads to a significant loss of contrast at small scales. This current work introduces two elementary studies. In a first time, in order to quantify the loss of contrast due to the use of Wallis filter, a simple multi-scale score is proposed based on mathematical morphology operations. In a second time, an optimal window size for the filter is identified by considering some systematic radiometric behaviours in the images forming the mosaic through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). These two elementary studies are preliminary steps leading to a method of radiometric correction combining Wallis filtering and PCA.  © Authors 2022},

To this end, radar measurements using tower-mounted antennas with a 15-min time step, along with physiology-related information (sapflow and micrometric dendrometry), were acquired quasi-continuously from March 2020 to December 2021 in an olive orchard located near Marrakech, Morocco. The article focused on temporal coherence, whose clear diurnal cycle (highest at night and lowest at the end of the afternoon) had been highlighted over tropical and boreal forests in previous studies. The results showed that coherence was highly sensitive to: wind-induced movement of scatterers, since coherence was lowest when wind speed was highest in late afternoon, and vegetation activity, especially its water dynamics, since the morning coherence drop coincided with the onset of sapflow and the daily evapotranspiration cycle, as well as the good agreement between the temporal drop rate of coherence and the daily residual variation in trunk circumference (i.e., deviation from long-term trend). Finally, coherence remained high for temporal baselines of several days, showing that sentinel-1 data (when both satellites are operational) may be well suited for such studies, especially with acquisitions made during morning passes, when wind speed is low. These results open perspectives for monitoring tree crop physiology using high-revisit-time radar observations. © 2024 The Authors.},

Starting with a collection of reported experiences of disorientation, this paper explores this notion from the spatial cognition, philosophical and human–computer interaction perspectives and proposes a model of disorientation in the exploration of multi-scale maps. We argue that disorientation is a problem of reconciliation between the current map view and the mental map of the user, where landmarks visible on the map or memorised in the mental map play a key role. The causes for failed reconciliation are discussed and illustrated by our collected experiences of disorientation. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Close-range remote sensing, and more particularly, its acquisition part that is linked to field robotics, is at the crossroads of many scientific and engineering fields. Thus, it takes time for students to acquire the solid foundations needed before practicing on real systems. Therefore, we are interested in a means that allow students without prerequisites to quickly appropriate the fundamentals of this interdisciplinary field. For this, we adapted a haggle game to the close-range remote sensing theme. In this article, we explain the mechanics that serve our educational purposes. We have used it, so far, for four academic years with hundreds of students. The experience was assessed through quality surveys and quizzes to calculate success indicators. The results show that the serious game is well appreciated by the students. It allows them to better structure information and acquire a good global vision of multi-domain acquisition and data processing in close-range remote sensing. The students are also more involved in the rest of the lessons; all of this helps to facilitate their learning of the theoretical parts. Thus, we were able to shorten the time before moving on to real practice by replacing three lesson sessions with one serious game session, with an increase in mastering fundamental skills. The designed serious game can be useful for close-range remote sensing teachers looking for an effective starting lesson. In addition, teachers from other technical fields can draw inspiration from the creation mechanisms described in this article to create their own adapted version. Such a serious game is also a good asset for selecting promising students in a recruitment context. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The adoption of technology in urban participatory planning with tools such as Virtual Geographic Environments (VGE) promises a broader engagement of urban dwellers, which should ultimately lead to the creation of better cities. However, the authorities and urban experts show hesitancy in endorsing these tools in their practices. Indeed, several parameters must be wisely considered in the design of VGE; if misjudged, their impact could be damaging for the participatory approach and the related urban project. The objective of this study is to engage participants (N = 107) with common tasks conducted in participatory sessions, in order to evaluate the users’ performance when manipulating a VGE. We aimed at assessing three crucial parameters: (1) the VGE representation, (2) the participants’ idiosyncrasies, and (3) the nature of the VGE format. The results demonstrate that the parameters did not affect the same aspect of users’ performance in terms of time, inputs, and correctness. The VGE representation impacts only the time needed to fulfill a task. The participants’ idiosyncrasies, namely age, gender and frequency of 3D use also induce an alteration in time, but spatial abilities seem to impact all characteristics of users’ performance, including correctness. Lastly, the nature of the VGE format significantly alters the time and correctness of users interactions. The results of this study highlight concerns about the inadequacies of the current VGE practices in participatory sessions. Moreover, we suggest guidelines to improve the design of VGE, which could enhance urban participatory planning processes, in order to create better cities. © 2022},

	abstract = {Land cover maps are a pivotal element in a wide range of Earth Observation (EO) applications. However, annotating large datasets to develop supervised systems for remote sensing (RS) semantic segmentation is costly and time-consuming. Unsupervised Domain Adaption (UDA) could tackle these issues by adapting a model trained on a source domain, where labels are available, to a target domain, without annotations. UDA, while gaining importance in computer vision, is still under-investigated in RS. Thus, we propose a new lightweight model, GeoMultiTaskNet, based on two contributions: a GeoMultiTask module (GeoMT), which utilizes geographical coordinates to align the source and target domains, and a Dynamic Class Sampling (DCS) strategy, to adapt the semantic segmentation loss to the frequency of classes. This approach is the first to use geographical metadata for UDA in semantic segmentation. It reaches state-of-the-art performances (47,22% mIoU), reducing at the same time the number of parameters (33M), on a subset of the FLAIR dataset, a recently proposed dataset properly shaped for RS UDA, used for the first time ever for research scopes here. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Land-use/land-cover (LULC) maps describe the Earth’s surface with discrete classes at a specific spatial resolution. The chosen classes and resolution highly depend on peculiar uses, making it mandatory to develop methods to adapt these characteristics for a large range of applications. Recently, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method was introduced to take into account both spatial and geographical context to translate a LULC map into another one. However, this model only works for two maps: one source and one target. Inspired by natural language translation using multiple-language models, this article explores how to translate one LULC map into several targets with distinct nomenclatures and spatial resolutions. We first propose a new data set based on six open access LULC maps to train our CNN-based encoder-decoder framework. We then apply such a framework to convert each of these six maps into each of the others using our Multi-Landcover Translation network (MLCT-Net). Extensive experiments are conducted at a country scale (namely France). The results reveal that our MLCT-Net outperforms its semantic counterparts and gives on par results with mono-LULC models when evaluated on areas similar to those used for training. Furthermore, it outperforms the mono-LULC models when applied to totally new landscapes. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Shape vectorization is a key stage of the digitization of large-scale historical maps, especially city maps that exhibit complex and valuable details. Having access to digitized buildings, building blocks, street networks and other geographic content opens numerous new approaches for historical studies such as change tracking, morphological analysis and density estimations. In the context of the digitization of Paris atlases created in the 19th and early 20th centuries, we have designed a supervised pipeline that reliably extract closed shapes from historical maps. This pipeline is based on a supervised edge filtering stage using deep filters, and a closed shape extraction stage using a watershed transform. It relies on probable multiple suboptimal methodological choices that hamper the vectorization performances in terms of accuracy and completeness. Objectively investigating which solutions are the most adequate among the numerous possibilities is comprehensively addressed in this paper. The following contributions are subsequently introduced: (i) we propose an improved training protocol for map digitization; (ii) we introduce a joint optimization of the edge detection and shape extraction stages; (iii) we compare the performance of state-of the-art deep edge filters with topology-preserving loss functions, including vision transformers; (iv) we evaluate the end-to-end deep learnable watershed against Meyer watershed. We subsequently design the critical path for a fully automatic extraction of key elements of historical maps.

The process of abstraction remains key to the immediate and successful interpretation of their many structures and geographical associations found at any given scale. Meaning is derived from such recognisable structures and map generalisation plays a critical role in communicating an entity's most characteristic and salient qualities. But what are these structures? How (and why) do they change over scale? Why are such questions relevant to automated mapping? In this paper we reflect on the value of perceptual studies and reconsider the context in which map generalisation now takes place. We review developments in pattern recognition techniques and the role played by machine learning techniques in identifying high level structures in abstracted maps. The benefits of their application include derivation of ontological descriptions of landscape, identification and preservation of salient landmarks across scales. We argue that a 'structuralist based approach' provides a more meaningful basis for measuring success and achieving more meaningful outputs. Ultimately the ambition is greater levels of automation in map generalisation, particularly in the context of web based solutions. © 2023 International Cartographic Association.},

However, reference databases do not exist everywhere or are not freely available. Thus, having data quality assessment methods that rely only on intrinsic indicators (i.e. based on data itself without considering external information) would be useful in these cases. This article specifically uses the radial distance as a target quality metric to measure the quality of shapes. Its aim is to build a random-forest based classification method that reconstructs whether this distance is higher or lower than a specified threshold, using only intrinsic indicators as inputs. The classification algorithm is evaluated on a first dataset by computing the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve and using the AUC (Area Under Curve) as an evaluation metric. The transferability of the resulting algorithm is then evaluated by measuring its performance on a second, distinct dataset. The experiments show that the algorithm performs reasonably well on both the initial and the second dataset, and that intrinsic indicators give relevant information to infer comparison-based shape quality (i.e. the radial distance). © Author(s) 2023.

However, the efficient exploitation of large amount of Sentinel-2 imagery still remain challenging on unexplored areas where state-of-The-Art classifiers are prone to fail. This paper focuses on Land-Cover mapping over Cameroon for the purpose of updating the Very High Resolution national topographic geodatabase. The <i>?</i>2 framework is adopted and tested for the specificity of the country. Here, experiments focus on generic vegetation classes (five) which enables providing robust focusing masks for higher resolution classifications. Two strategies are compared: (i) a LC map is calculated out of a year long time series and (ii) monthly LC maps are generated and merged into a single yearly map. Satisfactory accuracy scores are obtained (>94% in Overall Accuracy), allowing to provide a first step towards finer-grained map retrieval.  © Authors 2022.},

	abstract = {This paper is about the relevance of proposing geovisualization methods to visually integrate, co-visualize and interact with urban and meteorological data into a 3D environment, in order to support the visual analysis of the urban climate. Meteorological experts and researchers already face meteorological data and climate models analysis issues, at larger scales into the city: yet even if they have existing practices and tools to address these issues, they could take benefit from the knowledge and the methods from the Geovisualization domain, to complement these analyses by a visuospatial reasoning approach. In this paper, based on the knowledge of the expectations of the meteorological experts we are working with, we brought climate analysis into the city and visuospatial reasoning closer, on both heterogeneous urban and air temperature data(1). We reviewed the existing works regarding geovisualization of spatio-temporal phenomena and visualization of meteorological data (2). We then presented the different approaches we fulfilled to provide a 3D geovisualization environment and graphic representations, visually integrating both meteorological and spatial data. One provides style and interaction capacities on those data, enabling the interactive 3D exploration of their spatial and value distributions, throughout the city. Another geovisualization-design experiment is presented as a co-visualization of meteorological data and morphological indicators on 2.5D maps (3). These complementary approaches are presented and discussed with the meteorological experts, based on their relevance to tackle climate analysis at a larger scale and on the refinements required to extend their exploration capacities (4). © 2022 Geographie-Cites.

	abstract = {Map generalisation is a process that transforms geographic information for a cartographic at a specific scale. The goal is to produce legible and informative maps even at small scales from a detailed dataset. The potential of deep learning to help in this task is still unknown. This article examines the use case of mountain road generalisation, to explore the potential of a specific deep learning approach: generative adversarial networks (GAN). Our goal is to generate images that depict road maps generalised at the 1:250k scale, from images that depict road maps of the same area using un-generalised 1:25k data. This paper not only shows the potential of deep learning to generate generalised mountain roads, but also analyses how the process of deep learning generalisation works, compares supervised and unsupervised learning and explores possible improvements. With this experiment we have exhibited an unsupervised model that is able to generate generalised maps evaluated as good as the reference and reviewed some possible improvements for deep learning-based generalisation, including training set management and the definition of a new road connectivity loss. All our results are evaluated visually using a four questions process and validated by a user test conducted on 113 individuals. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

To produce them, the use of optical images alone remains limited. It is therefore necessary to make use of several heterogeneous sources, each carrying complementary or contradictory information due to their imperfections or their different specifications. This study compares two different approaches i.e. a pre-classification and a post-classification fusion approach for combining several sources of spatial data in the context of land use classification. The approaches are applied on authoritative land use data located in the Gers department in the south-west of France. Pre-classification fusion, while not explicitly modeling imperfections, has the best final results, reaching an overall accuracy of 97% and a macro-mean F1 score of 88%. © Author(s) 2023.},

Our method incorporates a fast algorithm to partition point clouds into a hierarchical superpoint structure, which makes our preprocessing 7 times faster than existing superpoint-based approaches. Additionally, we leverage a self-attention mechanism to capture the relationships between superpoints at multiple scales, leading to state-of-the-art performance on three challenging benchmark datasets: S3DIS (76.0% mIoU 6-fold validation), KITTI-360 (63.5% on Val), and DALES (79.6%). With only 212k parameters, our approach is up to 200 times more compact than other state-of-the-art models while maintaining similar performance. Furthermore, our model can be trained on a single GPU in 3 hours for a fold of the S3DIS dataset, which is 7× to 70× fewer GPU-hours than the best-performing methods.

While DIM provides dense surfaces, they are often noisy and contaminated with outliers. Conversely, LiDAR is more accurate and robust, but less dense and more expensive compared to DIM. In this work, we investigate learning-based methods to refine surfaces produced by photogrammetry with sparse LiDAR point clouds. Unlike the current state-of-the-art approaches in the computer vision community, our focus is on aerial acquisitions typical in photogrammetry. We propose a densification pipeline that adopts a PSMNet backbone with triangulated irregular network interpolation based expansion, feature enhancement in cost volume, and conditional cost volume normalization, i.e. PSMNet-FusionX3. Our method works better on low density and is less sensitive to distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness across a range of LiDAR point cloud densities and distributions, including analyses of dataset shifts. Furthermore, we have made both our aerial (image and disparity) dataset and code available for public use.

	abstract = {Automatic georeferencing for historical-to-nowadays aerial images represents the main ingredient for supplying territory evolution analysis and environmental monitoring. Existing georeferencing methods based on feature extraction and matching reported successful results for multi-epoch aerial images acquired in structured and man-made environments. While improving the state-of- the-art of the multi-epoch georeferencing problem, such frameworks present several limitations when applied to unstructured scenes, such as natural feature-less environments, characterized by homogenous or texture-less areas. This is mainly due to the lack of structured areas which often results in sparse and ambiguous feature matches, introducing inconsistencies during the pose estimation process. This paper addresses the automatic georeferencing problem for historical aerial images acquired in unstructured natural environments. The research work presented in this paper introduces a feature-less algorithm designed to perform historical-to- nowadays image matching for pose estimation in a fully automatic fashion. The proposed algorithm operates within two stages: (i) 2D patch extraction and matching and (ii) 3D patch-based local alignment. The final output is a set of 3D patch matches and the 3D rigid transformation relating each homologous patches. The obtained 3D point matches are designed to be injected into traditional multi-views pose optimisation engines. Experimental results on real datasets acquired over Fabas area situated in France demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our findings illustrate that the proposed georeferencing technique provides accurate results in presence of large periods of time separating historical from nowadays aerial images (up to 48 years time span).  © 2022.

	abstract = {Intact tropical rainforests have been exposed to severe droughts in recent decades, which may threaten their integrity, their ability to sequester carbon, and their capacity to provide shelter for biodiversity. However, their response to droughts remains uncertain due to limited high-quality, long-term observations covering extensive areas. Here, we examined how the upper canopy of intact tropical rainforests has responded to drought events globally and during the past 3 decades. By developing a long pantropical time series (1992 to 2018) of monthly radar satellite observations, we show that repeated droughts caused a sustained decline in radar signal in 93%, 84%, and 88% of intact tropical rainforests in the Americas, Africa, and Asia, respectively. Sudden decreases in radar signal were detected around the 1997-1998, 2005, 2010, and 2015 droughts in tropical Americas; 1999-2000, 2004-2005, 2010-2011, and 2015 droughts in tropical Africa; and 1997-1998, 2006, and 2015 droughts in tropical Asia. Rainforests showed similar low resistance (the ability to maintain predrought condition when drought occurs) to severe droughts across continents, but American rainforests consistently showed the lowest resilience (the ability to return to predrought condition after the drought event). Moreover, while the resistance of intact tropical rainforests to drought is decreasing, albeit weakly in tropical Africa and Asia, forest resilience has not increased significantly. Our results therefore suggest the capacity of intact rainforests to withstand future droughts is limited. This has negative implications for climate change mitigation through forest-based climate solutions and the associated pledges made by countries under the Paris Agreement. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

Despite the remarkable advances of the Natural Language Processing field, this task is still challenging for current state-of-the-art models because they are not necessarily trained on Twitter data and because high quality annotated data are still lacking for low resources languages. This research in progress address this gap describing an analytic pipeline able to automatically extract geolocatable entities from texts and to annotate them by aligning them with the entities present in Wikipedia/Wikidata resources.

This is partly due to the fact that map views do not always contain visual cues of the location of the past map views of the navigation. This paper presents an online study that seeks to understand and measure this disorientation occurring when zooming in or out of a pan-scalar map. An online study was designed and more than 150 participants finished the survey. The study shows a very small difference between the time to succeed in the memorising task after a zoom and a pan, but the difference is more significant when we compare zooming in with a large scale gap to panning. The study also shows that disorientation is not similar when zooming in and zooming out. © Guillaume Touya and Justin Berli.},

	abstract = {Urban environments are considered as complex systems where various dimensions are overlapping. Partly as a consequence of this stratification, they are facing a multitude of challenges and issues which have an impact on the quality of spaces. Efficient, responsible and reflective design of urban spaces is essential to progress towards sustainable urbanism and to improve life quality and the response to users' needs. Especially with the increasing complexity of today's urban systems. For these different reasons, design, analysis and evaluation methods must be adapted and take into account all the layers constituting the urban system. Following this line of thinking, a new intensity of uses index is developed in order to provide a holistic approach and to support sustainable planning as well as design and decision process for the development and improvement of spaces. In this article we present an analysis and design method for this index and more particularly the characterization of one of the variables that we call “Uses Potential”, based on different criteria. We define the structure whereby we develop the Uses Potential, i.e., on the basis of three elements constituting the urban systems: the spatial environment, the proposed content in its built components and its relative population. Then we review the technical content of the components on which the Uses Potential is based. We also address the question of its evaluation by means of a City Information Model (CIM) in our research and its contribution to future urban analyses. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Moreover, classical supervised deep learning methods have to deal with the limited amount of labelled data available.

As fully unsupervised experiments lead to unstable results, we suggest "low supervision"strategy composed of a warm-up stage with few labeled data able to drive the following unsupervised learning through reliable solutions.

	abstract = {Optical and radar satellite time series are synergetic: optical images contain rich spectral information, while C-band radar captures useful geometrical information and is immune to cloud cover. Motivated by the recent success of temporal attention-based methods across multiple crop mapping tasks, we propose to investigate how these models can be adapted to operate on several modalities. We implement and evaluate multiple fusion schemes, including a novel approach and simple adjustments to the training procedure, significantly improving performance and efficiency with little added complexity. We show that most fusion schemes have advantages and drawbacks, making them relevant for specific settings. We then evaluate the benefit of multimodality across several tasks: parcel classification, pixel-based segmentation, and panoptic parcel segmentation. We show that by leveraging both optical and radar time series, multimodal temporal attention-based models can outmatch single-modality models in terms of performance and resilience to cloud cover. To conduct these experiments, we augment the PASTIS dataset (Garnot and Landrieu, 2021a) with spatially aligned radar image time series. The resulting dataset, PASTIS-R, constitutes the first large-scale, multimodal, and open-access satellite time series dataset with semantic and instance annotations.

	abstract = {Deep learning techniques have recently been experimented for map generalization. Although promising, these experiments raise new problems regarding the evaluation of the output images. Traditional map generalization evaluation cannot directly be applied to the results in a raster format. Additionally, the internal evaluation used by deep learning models is mostly based on the realism of images and the accuracy of pixels, and none of these criteria is sufficient to evaluate a generalization process. Finally, deep learning processes tend to hide the causal mechanisms and do not always guarantee a result that follows cartographic principles. In this article, we propose a method to adapt constraint-based evaluation to the images generated by deep learning models. We focus on the use case of mountain road generalization, and detail seven raster-based constraints, namely, clutter, coalescence reduction, smoothness, position preservation, road connectivity preservation, noise absence, and color realism constraints. These constraints can contribute to current studies on deep learning-based map generalization, as they can help guide the learning process, compare different models, validate these models, and identify remaining problems in the output images. They can also be used to assess the quality of training examples. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

They can be used as a stable radar target in SAR images to connect local InSAR deformation maps to the global Terrestrial Reference Frame and for SAR absolute determination. During a test phase, the orientation of the CR was changed in order to be aligned toward all possible orbits of Sentinel-1A/1B satellites. On the different SAR images, the CR exhibits a high backscattering signal, and provides a Signal-to-Clutter Ratio larger than 26 dB. Since December 2018, the CR is specifically oriented toward the relative orbit 88. It is clearly detected as a PS in our InSAR analyses and as expected, the standard deviation of displacement measured on the CR is lower than on surrounding PS. A first local survey was performed to locate precisely this CR with respect to the existing geodetic instruments and annual campaigns have been carried out since then to insure its stability over time. © 2022 COSPAR},

In this paper, we study the influence of different parameters such as the sampling method, the density of the extracted cloud, the features selected (color, normal, elevation) as well as the number of points used at each training period.

	abstract = {Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key step in the creation of structured data from digitised historical documents. Traditional NER approaches deal with flat named entities, whereas entities are often nested. For example, a postal address might contain a street name and a number. This work compares three nested NER approaches, including two state-of-the-art approaches using Transformer-based architectures. We introduce a new Transformer-based approach based on joint labelling and semantic weighting of errors, evaluated on a collection of 19th-century Paris trade directories. We evaluate approaches regarding the impact of supervised fine-tuning, unsupervised pre-training with noisy texts, and variation of IOB tagging formats. Our results show that while nested NER approaches enable extracting structured data directly, they do not benefit from the extra knowledge provided during training and reach a performance similar to the base approach on flat entities. Even though all 3 approaches perform well in terms of F1-scores, joint labelling is most suitable for hierarchically structured data. Finally, our experiments reveal the superiority of the IO tagging format on such data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Urban functional zone mapping is essential for providing deeper insights into urban morphology and improving urban planning. The emergence of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), which provides abundant semantic data, offers a great opportunity to enrich land use information extracted from remote sensing (RS) images. Taking advantage of very-high-resolution (VHR) images and VGI data, this work proposed a SATL multifeature ensemble learning framework for mapping urban functional zones that integrated 65 features from the shapes of building objects, attributes of points of interest (POIs) tags, locations of cellphone users and textures of VHR images. The dimensionality of SALT features was reduced by the autoencoder, and the compressed features were applied to train the ensemble learning model composed of multiple classifiers for optimizing the urban functional zone classification. The effectiveness of the proposed framework was tested in an urbanized region of Nanchang City. The results indicated that the SALT features considering population dynamics and building shapes are comprehensive and feasible for urban functional zone mapping. The autoencoder has been proven efficient for dimension reduction of the original SALT features as it significantly improves the classification of urban functional zones. Moreover, the ensemble learning outperforms other machine learning models in terms of the accuracy and robustness when dealing with multi-classification tasks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The aim of the study is the synergy of radar Sentinel-1 and optical Sentinel-2 data for surface soil moisture (SSM) retrieval over wheat crops. The backscattering coefficient derived from Sentinel-1, is modeled using the Water Cloud Model (WCM) combined with Oh model. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed from Sentinel-2 is used as descriptor of vegetation in the WCM. The combined model is calibrated and validated using Sentiel-1/2 data and in situ measurement collected from two irrigated wheat fields located in the Haouz plain in the center of Morocco. The calibration is done at VV and VH polarizations and at 35.2° and 45.6° of incidence angles. Hereafter, an inversion approach is developed basing on the combined model for surface soil moisture retrieval. Results showed that SSM is retrieved with significant statistical metrics at VV polarization with R = 0.65, RMSE = 0.08 m3/m3 , and bias = −0.01 m3/m3 at 35.2° of incidence angle and R = 0.57, RMSE = 0.09 m3/m3 and bias = 0.01 m3/m3 at 45.6°. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {The work presented in this article was carried out following the fire (April 15, 2019) that ravaged Notre-Dame de Paris. The goal was to establish in a short and limited time-span the structural diagnosis of the remaining vaults of the cathedral. The analysis relied on 2D and 3D data acquired before and after the fire, and available at that time. Two complementary methods have been developed to estimate potential displacements from multi-temporal surveys. The first method is mainly based on the processing of image collections obtained with photogrammetric routines right after the fire. The second method, based on the processing of raw 3D data acquired with Terrestrial Laser Scanning, was developed afterward to refine and complete the analysis. Both methods have benefited from essential functionalities offered by two open-source solutions proven to enable “real-based” modeling in Cultural Heritage contexts, namely Micmac and CloudCompare. This paper presents the complementary use of these two software packages whilst detailing some procedural computing approaches to document and support structural diagnosis in an emergency situation. The limits and capabilities of each method are exposed and analyzed, toward the objective to develop 2.5D and 3D based geometrical analysis, respectively from photogrammetric and lasergrammetric sources.

	abstract = {This article tackles the problem of missing data imputation for noisy and non-Gaussian data. A classical imputation method, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for Gaussian mixture models, has shown interesting properties when compared to other popular approaches such as those based on $k$-nearest neighbors or on multiple imputations by chained equations. However, Gaussian mixture models are known to be non-robust to heterogeneous data, which can lead to poor estimation performance when the data is contaminated by outliers or have non-Gaussian distributions. To overcome this issue, a new EM algorithm is investigated for mixtures of elliptical distributions with the property of handling potential missing data. This paper shows that this problem reduces to the estimation of a mixture of angular Gaussian distributions under generic assumptions (i.e., each sample is drawn from a mixture of elliptical distributions, which is possibly different for one sample to another). In that case, the complete-data likelihood associated with mixtures of elliptical distributions is well adapted to the EM framework with missing data thanks to its conditional distribution, which is shown to be a multivariate $t$-distribution. Experimental results on synthetic data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is robust to outliers and can be used with non-Gaussian data. Furthermore, experiments conducted on real-world datasets show that this algorithm is very competitive when compared to other classical imputation methods.  © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

This study aims to explore these hierarchical relationships and the potential of hierarchical semantic segmentation for land cover mapping. We propose a hierarchical semantic segmentation architecture by taking advantage of dual U-shape network, named as HierU-Net. The coarse-level result is ingested to the fine-level segmentation functioned as soft constraints. The propagation of error will not be certain. Moreover, we employ a multi-task loss function weighted by homoscedastic uncertainty to optimize the training. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we create a hierarchical semantic segmentation dataset (HierToulouse), which contains 11,528 samples, including images and land cover labels at two hierarchical levels. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of achieving accurate land cover segmentation at both coarse and fine levels, with segmentation results surpassing those obtained using the flat method.

	abstract = {Automatically extracting geographic information from text is the key to harnessing the vast amount of spatial knowledge that only exists in this unstructured form. The fundamental elements of spatial knowledge include spatial entities, their types and the spatial relations between them. Structuring the spatial knowledge contained within text as a geospatial knowledge graph, and disambiguating the spatial entities, significantly facilitates its reuse. The automatic extraction of geographic information from text also allows the creation or enrichment of gazetteers. We propose a baseline approach for nested spatial entity and binary spatial relation extraction from text, a new annotated French-language benchmark dataset on the maritime domain that can be used to train algorithms for both extraction tasks, and benchmark results for the two tasks carried out individually and end-to-end. Our approach involves applying the Princeton University Relation Extraction system (PURE), made for flat, generic entity extraction and generic binary relation extraction, to the extraction of nested, spatial entities and spatial binary relations. By extracting nested spatial entities and the spatial relations between them, we have more information to aid entity disambiguation. In our experiments we compare the performance of a pretrained monolingual French BERT language model with that of a pretrained multilingual BERT language model, and study the effect of including cross-sentence context. Our results reveal very similar results for both models, although the multilingual model performs slightly better in entity extraction, and the monolingual model has slightly better relation extraction and end-to-end performances. We observe that increasing the amount of cross-sentence context improves the results for entity extraction whereas it has the opposite effect on relation extraction.  © 2023 ACM.},

	abstract = {Rationalizing the use of agricultural water is a key issue in semi-arid areas that face more and more water shortages while food security is already threatened by the increasing population. The FAO-56 approach has been developed to estimate the crop water requirement. It relies on an accurate estimation of the “basal crop coefficient” Kcb-act that has been shown to be closely related to NDVI. Nevertheless, optical data can be inoperant in case of persistent cloud cover. Within this context, the objective of this study is to assess the potentiality of the all-weather C-band Sentinel-1 radar observations available with 6-day revisit time at the field scale. To this end, the empirical relationships between Kcb-act, on one hand, and the interferometric coherence at VV (ρVV) and VH (ρVH) polarizations and the polarization ratio, on the other hand, were assessed on two wheat fields during two crop seasons and compared to the classical Kcb-act-NDVI method. It is demonstrated that while good statistical metrics are obviously obtained between Kcb-act and NDVI derived from Sentinel-2 (R = 0.77/0.88 and RMSE = 0.14/0.15 for Field 1/Field 2), close results are highlighted with radar data. The best metrics are found with ρVV: R = 0.76 and 0.77 and RMSE = 0.18 and 0.28 for Field 1 and Field 2, respectively. Using the calibrated relationships on one season of Field 1, reasonable estimates of ETc-act was found on Field 1 (R = 0.70, RMSE = 0.75 mm/day and bias = −0.18 mm/days using Kcb-act-ρVV). By contrast, a significant overestimations is highlighted both with ρVV (bias = 0.73 mm/day) and NDVI (bias = 1.46 mm/day) over Field 2. Interestingly, the Kcb-act-ρVV relationship is more consistent in the estimation of ETc-act when changing from one plot to another.

	abstract = {Parcels are the smallest units of land usually considered for urban development purposes. Analyses at the parcel level allow taking into account the administrative and physical environment of buildings with accuracy (roads, surrounding buildings, local design rules for building construction). In this article, we propose a free and open source software application, namely Parcel Manager, whose aims are twofold: (1) to assess the effects of different parcel reshaping rules and planning principles on the location, the number, and the shape of reshaped parcels; and (2) to provide a basis to assess the potential for new building construction. To this end, Parcel Manager simulates a large variety of parcel reshaping processes, with or without the joint creation of new roads, and produces realistic parcel layouts that represent either infill urban developments, edge expansions, or leapfrog developments. It can be used to determine if the densification of built parcels is feasible or not, regarding planning and design rules as well as the current urban fabric. The current version of Parcel Manager only concerns the reshaping of parcels dedicated to the construction of residential buildings but not other types of buildings. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The monitoring of coastal areas using remote sensing techniques is an important issue to determine the bio-optical properties of the water column and the seabed composition. New hyperspectral satellite sensors (e.g., PRISMA, DESIS or EnMap) are developed to periodically observe ecosystems. The uncertainties in the retrieved geophysical products remain a key issue to release reliable data useful for the end-users. In this study, an analytical approach based on Information theory is proposed to investigate the Cramér–Rao lower Bounds (CRB) for the uncertainties in the ocean color parameters. Practically, during the inversion process, an a priori knowledge on the estimated parameters is used since their range of variation is supposed to be known. Here, a Bayesian approach is attempted to handle such a priori knowledge. A Bayesian CRB (BCRB) is derived using the Lee et al. semianalytical radiative transfer model dedicated to shallow waters. Both environmental noise and bio-optical parameters are supposed to be random vectors that follow a Gaussian distibution. The calculation of CRB and BCRB is carried out for two hyperspectral images acquired above the French mediterranean coast. The images were obtained from the recently launched hyperspectral sensors, namely the DESIS sensor (DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer, German Aerospace Center), and PRISMA (Precursore IpperSpettrale della Mission Applicativa—ASI, Italian Space Adjency) sensor. The comparison between the usual CRB approach, the proposed BCRB approach and experimental errors obtained for the retrieved bathymetry shows the better ability of the BCRB to determine minimum error bounds. © 2023 by the authors.},

In line with this approach, this work focuses on the exploration, analysis and enrichment of a corpus of images and annotations of the cathedral, with regards to their temporal, spatial and semantic aspects, in addition to their visual content. Using prevailing clustering methods focusing on different criteria, we obtained several clusters of images from which new information can be inferred.

In this article, we propose new visibility-based metrics to assess the completeness and accuracy of three-dimensional meshes based on a point cloud of higher accuracy than the one from which the reconstruction has been computed. We use the position from which each high-quality point has been acquired to compute the corresponding ray of free space. Based on the intersections between each ray and the reconstructed surface, our metrics allow evaluating both the global coherency of the reconstruction and the accuracy at close range. We validate this evaluation protocol by surveying several open-source algorithms as well as a piece of licensed software on three data sets. The results confirm the relevance of assessi ng local and global accuracy separately since algorithms sometimes fail at guaranteeing both simultaneously. In addition, algorithms making use of sensor positions perform better than the ones relying only on points and normals, indicating a potentially significant added value of this piece of information.

	abstract = {Indoor/Outdoor modeling of buildings is an important issue in the field of building life cycle management. It is seen as a joint process where the two aspects collaborate to take advantage of their semantic and geometric complementary. This global approach will allow a more complete, correct, precise and coherent reconstruction of the buildings . The first issue of such modeling is thus to precisely register this data. The lack of overlap between indoor and outdoor data is the most encountered obstacle, more so when both data sets are acquired separately and using different types of sensors. As an opening in the façade is the unique common entity that can be seen from inside and outside, it can help the registration of indoor and outdoor point clouds. So it must be automatically, accurately and efficiently extracted. In this paper,we start by proposing a very efficient algorithm to detect openings with great precision in both indoor and outdoor scans. Afterwards, we integrate them in a registration framework. As an opening is defined by a rectangular shape composed of four segments, two horizontal and two vertical, we can write our registration problem as a minimization of a global robust distance between two segment sets and propose a robust approach to minimize this distance using the RANSAC paradigm.  © 2022.

Our project is ongoing, and, in this paper, we present intermediate results on the potential of this CIM to support the automated quantification of our urban intensity indicator. We also describe the solutions currently implemented so that our experimental CIM can provide the necessary information for a more complete and automated urban intensity analysis. Finally, we shed light on key issues regarding the use of CIM, specifically CIM made up of various BIM models (of buildings lots and public spaces) for urban analysis at the district scale during the design phase. These issues include the need to generalize BIM entities and to manage property sets and nomenclatures to allow automation of analyses at the district scale, as long as there is no BIM+ data model allowing for urban analysis.  © 2021 A.

	abstract = {Indoor mapping attracts more attention with the development of 2D and 3D camera and Lidar sensor. Lidar systems can provide a very high resolution and accurate point cloud. When aiming to reconstruct the static part of the scene, moving objects should be detected and removed which can prove challenging. This paper proposes a generic method to merge meshes produced from Lidar data that allows to tackle the issues of moving objects removal and static scene reconstruction at once. The method is adapted to a platform collecting point cloud from two Lidar sensors with different scan direction, which will result in different quality. Firstly, a mesh is efficiently produced from each sensor by exploiting its natural topology. Secondly, a visibility analysis is performed to handle occlusions (due to varying viewpoints) and remove moving objects. Then, a boolean optimization allows to select which triangles should be removed from each mesh. Finally, a stitching method is used to connect the selected mesh pieces. Our method is demonstrated on a Navvis M3 (2D laser ranger system) dataset and compared with Poisson and Delaunay based reconstruction methods. © 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.},

	abstract = {Dense time series of optical satellite imagery describing vegetation activity provide essential information for the efficient and regular monitoring of vegetation. Nevertheless, the temporal resolution of optical sensors is strongly affected by cloud cover, resulting in significant missing information. The use of complementary acquisitions, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, opens the door to the development of new multi-sensor methodologies aiming at the reconstruction of missing information. However, the joint exploitation of new radar and optical missions, such as the Sentinel, raises new challenges given the different nature and response of the two data sources. In this work, the SenRVM methodology is proposed as a new multi-sensor approach to regress SAR time series towards Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). A deep Recurrent Neural Network architecture which integrates SAR acquisitions and ancillary data is adopted. The regression task permits a continuous optical temporal resolution of 6 days. Multiple experiments are carried out to assess the SenRVM framework by studying two large-scale areas in France. Through an extensive interpretation of the results, SenRVM is evaluated on three main vegetation types (grasslands, crops, and forests). High accurate results (R2 > 0.83 and MAE < 0.05) over more than 140,000 vegetation polygons are obtained, both for multi-class and class-specific models. The importance of the SenRVM input features is discussed through an ablation study, highlighting that the relevance of the features differs for the various classes. The good performances of SenRVM are assessed by evaluating the quality of the reconstruction over short- and long-term data gaps. Results are compared to five state-of-the-art methodologies. Finally, some preliminary experiments are first carried out to show how SenRVM results could be used to improve the existing cloud & shadow masks. The recovering of time series breaks caused by vegetation cover changes is also illustrated. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Data quality assessment of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data can be carried out by comparing them with a reference spatial data (e.g authoritative data). However, in case of a lack of reference data, the spatial accuracy is unknown. The aim of this work is therefore to propose a framework to infer relative spatial accuracy of OSM data by using machine learning methods. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that there is a relationship between extrinsic and intrinsic quality measures. Thus, starting from a multi-criteria data matching, the process seeks to establish a statistical relationship between measures of extrinsic quality of OSM (i.e. obtained by comparison with reference spatial data) and the measures of intrinsic quality of OSM (i.e. OSM features themselves) in order to estimate extrinsic quality on an unevaluated OSM dataset. The approach was applied on OSM buildings. On our dataset, the resulting regression model predicts the values on the extrinsic quality indicators with 30% less variance than an uninformed predictor.  © Copyright: },

	abstract = {Up-to-date land cover maps are important for biodiversity monitoring as they are central to habitat and ecosystem distribution assessments. Satellite remote sensing is a key technology for generating these maps. Until recently, land cover mapping has been limited to static approaches, which have primarily led to the production of either global maps at coarse spatial resolutions or geographically restricted maps at high spatial resolutions. The recent availability of optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) satellite image time series (SITS) which provide access to high spatial and very high temporal resolutions, is a game changer, offering opportunities to map land cover using both temporal and spatial information. These data moreover open interesting perspectives for land cover mapping based on data combination approach. However, the usefulness of combining dense time series (more than 30 images per year) and data combination approaches to map natural vegetation has so far not been assessed. To address this gap, this contribution tests the idea that the combined consideration of optical and radar data combination and time series analyses can significantly improve natural vegetation mapping in the Pendjari National Park, a Sahelian savanna protected area in Benin. Results highlight that the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 SITS performs as well as Sentinel-2 SITS alone in terms of classification accuracy. Land cover maps are however qualitatively better when considering the data combination approach. Our results also clearly show that the use of dense/hypertemporal optical time series significantly improves classification outcomes compared to using multitemporal only a few images per year) or monotemporal data. Altogether, this work thus demonstrates the ability of dense SITS to improve discrimination of natural vegetation types using information on their phenology, leading to more detailed and more reliable maps for environmental management. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Images from archival aerial photogrammetric surveys are a unique and relatively unexplored means to chronicle 3D land-cover changes occurred since the mid 20th century. They provide a relatively dense temporal sampling of the territories with a very high spatial resolution. Thus, they offer time series data which can answer a large variety of long-term environmental monitoring studies. Besides, they are generally stereoscopic surveys, making it possible to derive 3D information (Digital Surface Models). In recent years, they have often been digitized, making them more suitable to be considered in automatic analyses processes. Some photogrammetric softwares make it possible to retrieve their geometry (pose and camera calibration) and to generate corresponding DSM and orthophotomosaic. Thus, archival aerial photogrammetric surveys appear as being a powerful remote sensing data source to study land use/cover evolution over the last century. However, several difficulties have to be faced to be able to use them in automatic analysis processes. Indeed, surveys available on a study area can exhibit very different characteristics: Survey pattern, focal, spatial resolution, modality (panchromatic, colour, infrared&hellip;). Planimetric and altimetric accuracies of derived products strongly depend on these characteristics. Thus, analysis processes have to cope with these uncertainties. Another important gap states in the lack of training data. Deep learning methods and especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are at present the most efficient semantic segmentation methods as long as a sufficient training dataset is available. However, temporal gaps can be very important between existing available databases and archival data. In this study, two custom variants of simple yet effective U-net-Deconv-Net inspired DL architectures are developed to process ortho-image and DSM based information. They are then trained out of a groundtruth derived out of a recent database to process archival datasets. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved.},

We use as input detailed buildings, roads, and rivers from topographic datasets produced by the French national mapping agency (IGN), and we expect as output of the GAN a legible map of these elements at a target scale of 1:50,000. This level of detail requires to reduce the amount of information while preserving patterns; covering dense inner cities block by a unique polygon is also necessary because these blocks cannot be represented with enlarged individual buildings. The target map has a style similar to the topographic map produced by IGN. This experiment succeeded in producing image tiles that look like legible maps. It also highlights the impact of data and representation choices on the quality of predicted images, and the challenge of learning geographic relationships. © Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {Updating an authoritative Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) database requires many resources. Volunteered geographic information (VGI) involves citizens in the collection of data about their spatial environment. There is a growing interest in using existing VGI to update authoritative databases. This paper presents a framework aimed at integrating multi-source VGI based on a data fusion technique, in order to update an authoritative land use database. Each VGI data source is considered to be an independent source of information, which is fused together using Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). The framework is tested in the updating of the authoritative land use data produced by the French National Mapping Agency. Four data sets were collected from several in-situ and remote campaigns run between 2018 and 2020 by contributors with varying profiles. The data fusion approach achieved an overall accuracy of 85.6% for the 144 features having at least two contributions when the confidence threshold was set to 0.05. Despite the heterogeneity and limited amount of VGI used, the results are promising, with 99% of the LU polygons updated or enriched. These results show the potential of using multi-source VGI to update or enrich authoritative LU data and potentially LULC data more generally. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a neoteric and high-efficiency single image dehazing algorithm via contrast enhancement which is called STRASS (Spatio-Temporal Retinex-Inspired by an Averaging of Stochastic Samples) dehazing, it is realized by constructing an efficient high-pass filter to process haze images and taking the influence of human vision system into account in image dehazing principles. The novel high-pass filter works by getting each pixel using RSR and computes the average of the samples. Then the low-pass filter resulting from the minimum envelope in STRESS framework has been replaced by the average of the samples. The final dehazed image is yielded after iterations of the high-pass filter. STRASS can be run directly without any machine learning. Extensive experimental results on datasets prove that STRASS surpass the state-of-the-arts. Image dehazing can be applied in the field of printing and packaging, our method is of great significance for image pre-processing before printing. © 2022, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the distributed computation of Delaunay triangulations of massive point sets, mainly motivated by the needs of a scalable out-of-core surface reconstruction workflow from massive urban LIDAR datasets. Such a data often corresponds to a huge point cloud represented through a set of tiles of relatively homogeneous point sizes. This will be the input of our algorithm which will naturally partition this data across multiple processing elements. The distributed computation and communication between processing elements is orchestrated efficiently through an uncentralized model to represent, manage and locally construct the triangulation corresponding to each tile. Initially inspired by the star splaying approach, we review the Tile& Merge algorithm for computing Distributed Delaunay Triangulations on the cloud, provide a theoretical proof of correctness of this algorithm, and analyse the performance of our Spark implementation in terms of speedup and strong scaling in both synthetic and real use case datasets. A HPC implementation (e.g. using MPI), left for future work, would benefit from its more efficient message passing paradigm but lose the robustness and failure resilience of our Spark approach. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Main map features can be retrieved and tracked through the time for subsequent thematic analysis. The goal of this work is the vectorization step, i.e., the extraction of vector shapes of the objects of interest from raster images of maps. We are particularly interested in closed shape detection such as buildings, building blocks, gardens, rivers, etc. in order to monitor their temporal evolution. Historical map images present significant pattern recognition challenges. The extraction of closed shapes by using traditional Mathematical Morphology (MM) is highly challenging due to the overlapping of multiple map features and texts. Moreover, state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are perfectly designed for content image filtering but provide no guarantee about closed shape detection. Also, the lack of textural and color information of historical maps makes it hard for CNN to detect shapes that are represented by only their boundaries. Our contribution is a pipeline that combines the strengths of CNN (efficient edge detection and filtering) and MM (guaranteed extraction of closed shapes) in order to achieve such a task. The evaluation of our approach on a public dataset shows its effectiveness for extracting the closed boundaries of objects in historical maps. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Cartographic generalization is a process similar to text summarization that transforms a map when scale is reduced. Cartographic generalization simplifies the map content while preserving as much as possible the initial characteristics and spatial relations of the map. The automation of this process requires a deep understanding of the context of each map feature, which involves different criteria such as the shape of the feature, the semantic nature of the feature, or the spatial patterns of its neighbouring features. This is why multiple criteria decision techniques can be relevant during the process. This paper proposes two use cases of cartographic generalization sub-tasks where multiple criteria decision techniques improve past techniques: the classification of urban building blocks and the ordering of the buildings to keep in the map as a priority. In both use cases, the proposed methods are experimented on large real cartographic datasets, and evaluated in comparison to alternative techniques. © 2021 British Cartographic Society.},

Monitoring the water stress status of plants can contribute to an optimal use of irrigation. C-band radar data have shown great potential for monitoring soil and vegetation hydric conditions. While a diurnal cycle up to 1 dB has been observed over tropical forests, the behavior of annual crops is yet to be investigated. In this context, an experiment composed of a radar setup with 6 C-band antennas was installed in Morocco over a wheat field. 15 minutes full polarization acquisitions of the backscattering coefficient and the interferometric coherence are analyzed in relation with the physiological functioning of wheat. In this paper, the first results from the analysis of data collected during the 2020 growing season are presented. The results reveal the existence of a diurnal cycle of the interferometric coherence and the backscattering coefficient (up to 0.45 and 1.5 dB, respectively) with amplitudes increase in relation with vegetation development. © 2022 IEEE.},

The study area chosen is the Cameroon Estuary. This area represents a major ecological transition in the sub-region with the presence of protected natural reserves (mangroves, dense forest, wetlands) but also a strong anthropic activity (construction, agriculture, degraded forest). The methodological approach consisted of a chain of pre-processing and visual image analysis, followed by a combination of the bands from each sensor, a supervised Random Forest classification to draft a land use map and finally a digitization of the coastline. Overall, the results show that the classification with the Sentinel2 images using 10 bands and adding 4 vegetation indices is slightly more accurate (95.75 %) than the classification with the 13 initial bands (91.78 %). The classification performed with the Sentinel-1A multi-temporal image series (dual polarization (VV, VH) and VV/VH ratio) leads to an accuracy of 78.44 %. The combination of Sentinel-2 A&B bands (10 bands and 4 indices) and Sentinel-1 improves the results and leads to an accuracy of 98.76 %. Our results also show that the use of multi-temporal image time series significantly improves the classification accuracy compared to the use of a single image (mono-date), and this for both sensors, i.e. an additional gain of 13 % and 10 % respectively for Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1. However, this gain remains small for temporally stable classes. The results of the coastline evolution analysis show that the Cameroon estuary is disturbed by different levels of erosion (Cape Cameroon, North Manoka Island, Sanaga River mouth), and accretion (Limbe, and South Manoka Island) and also by weak internal variations. The fusion of optical and radar remote sensing data in the discrimination of land use classes, has shown that the construction zones are the most vulnerable to coastal erosion. On the other hand, the presence of vegetation (mangrove, forest) stabilizes and protects the coast from possible risks of this nature. © 2021 Soc. Francaise de Photogrammetrie et de Teledetection.

	abstract = {In this article, we evaluate the classification performance of three non-parametric algorithms (kNN, RF and SVM), using multi-temporal data from three satellites (Sentinel-1, Alos-Palsar-2 and Sentinel-2) and their combinations. The study area selected is characterized by a subhumid Mediterranean climate and a very rough topography, making it especially difficult to classify land cover. In addition, it contains a protected area named Jbel Moussa and presents exceptional biological diversity. We have acquired and pre-processed optical and radar satellite images from January 1 to December 31, 2017, to track vegetation cover. Then to produce twelve scenarios, we combined the three satellites. Classification maps illustrate our approach. A total of thirty-six classifications were carried out, based on seven classes: water, building and infrastructure, bare soil, sparse vegetation, grasslands, sparse forest and dense forest. The results showed that the highest overall accuracy was provided for all scenarios by RF (53.03%-93.06%), followed by kNN (49.16%-89.63%), while the lowest classification accuracy was created by SVM (47.86%-86.08%). The study also showed a similarity between the performance of the three satellites combination and that of Sentinel-2 alone. Area estimates vary from 0.85 km2 (0.11% of the study area) to 326.84 km2 (41.31% of the study area) for various classes. © 2021 Soc. Francaise de Photogrammetrie et de Teledetection.

These tactile maps are crucial at school to learn geography and history as well as the other students. They are produced manually by professional transcriptors in a very long and costly process. A platform able to generate tactile maps from maps scanned from geography textbooks could be extremely useful to these transcriptors, to fasten their production. As a first step towards such a platform, this paper proposes a method to infer the scale and the content of the map from its image. We used convolutional neural networks trained with a few hundred maps from French geography textbooks, and the results show promising results to infer labels about the content of the map (e.g. "there are roads, cities and administrative boundaries"), and to infer the extent of the map (e.g. a map of France or of Europe).  © 2020 Authors.},

	abstract = {In many classification tasks, the set of target classes can be organized into a hierarchy. This structure induces a semantic distance between classes, and can be summarized under the form of a cost matrix, which defines a finite metric on the class set. In this paper, we propose to model the hierarchical class structure by integrating this metric in the supervision of a prototypical network. Our method relies on jointly learning a feature-extracting network and a set of class prototypes whose relative arrangement in the embedding space follows an hierarchical metric. We show that this approach allows for a consistent improvement of the error rate weighted by the cost matrix when compared to traditional methods and other prototype-based strategies. Furthermore, when the induced metric contains insight on the data structure, our method improves the overall precision as well. Experiments on four different public datasets-from agricultural time series classification to depth image semantic segmentation-validate our approach. © 2021.

	abstract = {Pervasive data have become a key source of information for mobility and transportation analyses. However, as a secondary source, it has a different methodological origin than travel survey data, usually relying on unsupervised algorithms, and so it requires to be assessed as a dataset. This assessment is challenging, because, in general, there is not a benchmark dataset or a ground truth scenario available, as travel surveys only represent a partial view of the phenomenon and suffer from their own biases. For this critical task, which involves urban planners and data scientists, we study the design space of the visualization of cross-origin, multivariate flow datasets. For this purpose, we introduce the Modalflow system, which incorporates and adapts different visualization techniques in a notebook-like setting, presenting novel visual encodings and interactions for flows with modal partition into scatterplots, flow maps, origin-destination matrices, and ternary plots. Using this system, we extract general insights on visual analysis of pervasive and survey data for urban mobility and assess a mobile phone network dataset for one metropolitan area. © 2020 by the authors.

Consequently, the use of remotely sensed data is the norm in landscape studies, and there is a strong association between remote sensing and landscape ecology. This chapter examines the constant improvements in remote sensing technologies and their application to landscape ecology, from sensors onboard planes and satellites to ground-based devices and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones). After existing sensors and approaches, current and future opportunities are surveyed. Current tools for mapping vegetation and ecosystem, investigating spatial structure, examining landscape processes, and understanding anthropogenic drivers of landscape change are based on combinations of passive (e.g., hyperspectral) and active (e.g., LiDAR) sensors. Future opportunities will come from new sensors on board new satellites, combined with citizen science for ground truthing and cloud computing for analyzing ever larger volumes of remotely sensed data. As sensors become diverse and the platforms on which they sit more versatile, opportunities from remote sensing to broaden the scope of landscape ecology and its research questions will only continue to grow. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Robert A.

	abstract = {Recent works on 3D semantic segmentation propose to exploit the synergy between images and point clouds by processing each modality with a dedicated network and projecting learned 2D features onto 3D points. Merging large-scale point clouds and images raises several challenges, such as constructing a mapping between points and pixels, and aggregating features between multiple views. Current methods require mesh reconstruction or specialized sensors to recover occlusions, and use heuristics to select and aggregate available images. In contrast, we propose an end-to-end trainable multi-view aggregation model leveraging the viewing conditions of 3D points to merge features from images taken at arbitrary positions. Our method can combine standard 2D and 3D networks and outperforms both 3D models operating on colorized point clouds and hybrid 2D/3D networks without requiring colorization, meshing, or true depth maps. We set a new state-of-the-art for large-scale indoor/outdoor semantic segmentation on S3DIS (74.7 mIoU 6-Fold) and on KITTI-360 (58.3 mIoU). Our full pipeline is accessible at https://github.com/drprojects/DeepViewAgg, and only requires raw 3D scans and a set of images and poses. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {One major goal of structural health monitoring (SHM) is to detect, and possibly locate, quantify or predict damage on structures. Without detailed knowledge of structural mechanical behavior, data analysis is a complex task and operational monitoring is often limited to the use of more or less arbitrary thresholds. Data-driven techniques, which rely on a statistical analysis of data, have encountered a growing interest over the past two decades. In parallel, SHM is now increasingly considered for several types of structures with the development of low-cost sensors and IoT. In this context, this paper proposes an approach based on multiple automated machine learning-based models for novelty detection and location in monitoring data. This study focuses on the monitoring of large structures with multiple sensors. For each sensor, multiple regression models (based on neural networks) are generated using the same training set, with various input data: internal temperature, environmental conditions, or data from other sensors deployed on the structure. Anomalies are then identified in the dataset based on residuals between model outputs and in situ data. For a given sensor, residuals of all models are then compiled to produce an anomaly indicator. This paper presents some of the results obtained on data acquired from the monitoring of a large concrete bridge. Some anomalies are simulated and added to the dataset to demonstrate the detection performance of the proposed approach. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Visual localization is a useful alternative to standard localization techniques. It works by utilizing cameras. In a typical scenario, features are extracted from captured images and compared with geo-referenced databases. Location information is then inferred from the matching results. Conventional schemes mainly use low-level visual features. These approaches offer good accuracy but suffer from scalability issues. In order to assist localization in large urban areas, this work explores a different path by utilizing high-level semantic information. It is found that object information in a street view can facilitate localization. A novel descriptor scheme called “semantic signature” is proposed to summarize this information. A semantic signature consists of type and angle information of visible objects at a spatial location. Several metrics and protocols are proposed for signature comparison and retrieval. They illustrate different trade-offs between accuracy and complexity. Extensive simulation results confirm the potential of the proposed scheme in large-scale applications. This paper is an extended version of a conference paper in CBMI’18. A more efficient retrieval protocol is presented with additional experiment results. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Historical imagery is characterized by high spatial resolution and stereoscopic acquisitions, providing a valuable resource for recovering 3D land-cover information. Accurate geo-referencing of diachronic historical images by means of self-calibration remains a bottleneck because of the difficulty to find sufficient amount of feature correspondences under evolving landscapes. In this research, we present a fully automatic approach to detecting feature correspondences between historical images taken at different times (i.e., inter-epoch), without auxiliary data required. Based on relative orientations computed within the same epoch (i.e., intra-epoch), we obtain DSMs (Digital Surface Model) and incorporate them in a rough-to-precise matching. The method consists of: (1) an inter-epoch DSMs matching to roughly co-register the orientations and DSMs (i.e, the 3D Helmert transformation), followed by (2) a precise inter-epoch feature matching using the original RGB images. The innate ambiguity of the latter is largely alleviated by narrowing down the search space using the co-registered data. With the inter-epoch feature correspondences, we refine the image orientations and quantitatively evaluate the results (1) with DoD (Difference of DSMs), (2) with ground check points, and (3) by quantifying ground displacement due to an earthquake. We demonstrate that our method: (1) can automatically georeference diachronic historical images; (2) can effectively mitigate systematic errors induced by poorly estimated camera parameters; (3) is robust to drastic scene changes. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our method improves the image georeferencing accuracy by a factor of 2. The proposed methods are implemented in MicMac, a free, open-source photogrammetric software. © 2021 The Authors},

These images are in particular of utter interest to map Land-Cover (LC) at large scale. LC maps can now be computed on a yearly basis at the scale of a country with efficient supervised classifiers, assuming suitable training data are available. However, the efficient exploitation of large amount of Sentinel-2 imagery still remain challenging on unexplored areas where state-of-the-art classifiers are prone to fail. This paper focuses on Land-Cover mapping over Cameroon for the purpose of updating the national topographic geodatabase. The i &iota;/i 2 framework is adopted and tested for the specificity of the country. Here, experiments focus on generic classes (five) which enables providing robust focusing masks for higher resolution classifications. Two strategies are compared: (i) a LC map is calculated out of a year long time series and (ii) monthly LC maps are generated and merged into a single yearly map.

Nevertheless, the capturing devices used to acquire these images possessed a diversity of effects that influenced the quality of the final resulting picture, e.g. geometric distortion, chromatic aberration, depth of field variation, etc. This paper examines singularly the topic of geometric distortion for a co-visualization of historical photos within a 3D model of the photographed scene. A distortion function of an image is ordinarily estimated only on the image domain by adjusting its parameters to observations of point correspondences. This mathematical function may exhibit overfits, oscillations or may not be well defined outside of this domain. The contribution of this work is the description of a distortion model defined on the whole undistorted image plane. We extrapolate the distortion estimated only on the image domain and then transfer this distortion information to the view of the 3D scene. This enables to look at the scene through an estimated camera and zoom out to see the context around the original photograph with a well-defined and behaved distortion. These findings may be a significant addition to the overall purpose of creating innovative ways to examine and visualize old photographs. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Tree height and crown diameter are two common individual tree attributes that can be estimated from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images thanks to photogrammetry and structure from motion. This research investigates the potential of low-cost UAV aerial images to estimate tree height and crown diameter. Two successful flights were carried out in two different seasons corresponding to leaf-off and leaf-on conditions to generate a digital terrain model and a digital surface model, which were further employed in calculation of a canopy height model (CHM). The CHM was used to estimate tree height using low pass and local maximum filters, and crown diameter was estimated based on an inverse watershed segmentation algorithm. UAV-based tree height and crown diameter estimates were validated against field measurements and resulted in 3.22 m (10.1%) and 0.81 m (7.02%) root mean square errors, respectively. The results showed high agreement between our estimates and field measurements, with an R2 of 0.808 for tree height and an R2 of 0.923 for crown diameter. Generally, the accuracy of the results was considered acceptable and confirmed the usefulness of this approach for estimating tree heights and crown diameter. © 2021, Canadian Science Publishing.

	abstract = {The registration of indoor and outdoor scans with a precision reaching the level of geometric noise represents a major challenge for Indoor/Outdoor building modeling. The basic idea of the contribution presented in this paper consists in extracting planar polygons from indoor and outdoor LiDAR scans, and then matching them. In order to cope with the very small overlap between indoor and outdoor scans of the same building, we propose to start by extracting points lying in the buildings' interior from the outdoor scans as points where the laser ray crosses detected façades. Since, within a building environment, most of the objects are bounded by a planar surface, we propose a new registration algorithm that matches planar polygons by clustering polygons according to their normal direction, then by their offset in the normal direction. We use this clustering to find possible polygon correspondences (hypotheses) and estimate the optimal transformation for each hypothesis. Finally, a quality criteria is computed for each hypothesis in order to select the best one. To demonstrate the accuracy of our algorithm, we tested it on real data with a static indoor acquisition and a dynamic (Mobile Laser Scanning) outdoor acquisition.  © Author(s) 2021.},

Areas subject to multiple human interventions, such as grasslands, are particularly concerned. A Recurrent Neural Network multi-sensor regression approach (SenRVM), relying on the systematic acquisitions of Sentinel-1 SAR satellite, has been thereby proposed. It permits to retrieve vegetation indexes, derived from Sentinel-2 optical imagery, despite significant cloud cover and with high sampling (6 days). The benefit of SenRVM for filling gaps in vegetation time-series describing agricultural practices is assessed. The proposed approach is compared with classical mono-sensor optical strategies. We adopt a synthetic dataset with large gaps. This realistically mimicks challenging conditions in grassland exploitation detection. Results obtained both for exploited and stable parcels satisfactorily demonstrate the relevance of our approach. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Most contemporary supervised image segmentation methods do not preserve the initial topology of the given input (like the closeness of the contours). One can generally remark that edge points have been inserted or removed when the binary prediction and the ground truth are compared. This can be critical when accurate localization of multiple interconnected objects is required. In this paper, we present a new loss function, called, Boundary-Aware loss (BALoss), based on the Minimum Barrier Distance (MBD) cut algorithm. It is able to locate what we call the leakage pixels and to encode the boundary information coming from the given ground truth. Thanks to this adapted loss, we are able to significantly refine the quality of the predicted boundaries during the learning procedure. Furthermore, our loss function is differentiable and can be applied to any kind of neural network used in image processing. We apply this loss function on the standard U-Net and DC U-Net on Electron Microscopy datasets. They are well-known to be challenging due to their high noise level and to the close or even connected objects covering the image space. Our segmentation performance, in terms of Variation of Information (VOI) and Adapted Rank Index (ARI), are very promising and lead to ∼15% better scores of VOI and ∼5% better scores of ARI than the state-of-the-art.

	abstract = {The Corona KH-4 reconnaissance satellite missions acquired panoramic stereo imagery with high spatial resolution of 1.8-7.5 m from 1962 to 1972. The potential of 800000+ declassified Corona images has not been leveraged due to the complexities arising from handling of panoramic imaging geometry, film distortions, and limited availability of the metadata required for georeferencing of the Corona imagery. This article presents the Corona Stereo Pipeline (CoSP): A pipeline for processing of Corona KH-4 stereo panoramic imagery. CoSP utilizes the deep learning-based feature matcher SuperGlue to automatically match feature points between Corona KH-4 images and recent satellite imagery to generate ground control points (GCPs). To model the imaging geometry and the scanning motion of the panoramic KH-4 cameras, a rigorous camera model consisting of modified collinearity equations with time-dependent exterior orientation parameters is employed. Using the entire frame of the Corona image, bundle adjustment with well-distributed GCPs results in an average standard deviation (SD) or σ0 of less than two pixels. We evaluate fiducial marks on the Corona films and show that pre-processing the Corona images to compensate for film bending improves the 3-D reconstruction accuracy. The distortion pattern of image residuals of GCPs and y-parallax in epipolar resampled images suggest that film distortions due to long-term storage likely cause systematic deviations of up to six pixels. Compared to the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM), the Corona DEM computed using CoSP achieved a normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) of elevation differences of ≈ 4 m over an area of approximately 4000 km2 after a tile-based fine coregistration of the DEMs. We further assess CoSP on complex scenes involving high relief and glacierized terrain and show that the resulting DEMs can be used to compute long-term glacier elevation changes over large areas. © 1980-2012 IEEE.},

The objective of this paper is to present the preliminary results of an experiment carried out on a winter wheat field in Morocco that was instrumented with six C-band antennas during 2020 growing season. The preliminary results showed strong daily cycles of ? and s0 that are analyzed in relation to wind speed, surface soil moisture and evapotranspiration.

The proposed method mainly assumes that the map of interest spatially overlaps at least with one of the other maps. High performance translation is achieved with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based encoder-decoder frame-work trained with three goals: (i) high-quality translation; (ii) self-reconstruction ability; (iii) mapping of all datasets into a common representation space. Country-scale experimental results show the method effectiveness in translating six highly heterogeneous land-cover maps, achieving significantly better results than the traditional semantic-based method and better results than CNN trained for a 1-1 translation task (+ 9.7% in Overall Accuracy (OA) and +12% in macro F1-score (mF1)). © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The spatial analysis of health data usually raises geoprivacy issues. Due to the virulence of COVID-19, scientists and crisis managers do need to analyze the distribution and spread of the disease with spatially precise data. In particular, it is useful to locate each case on a map to identify clusters of cases. To allow such analyses without breach of geoprivacy, geomasking techniques are necessary. This paper experiments with the geomasking techniques from the literature to solve this problem: masking the real address of positive cases while preserving the local spatial cluster patterns. In particular, two different approaches based on aggregation and perturbation are adapted to the geomasking of addresses in areas with different densities of population. A new simulated cluster crowding method is also proposed to preserve clusters as much as possible. The results show that geomasking techniques can spatially anonymize addresses while preserving clusters, and the best geomasking method depends on the use of the anonymized data. © 2021 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.},

Acceleration of their production requires standardized design guidelines that consider symbol design and production methods. In this paper, based on a review of research and best practice, we summarize knowledge on how to design tactile maps properly and provide a selection of highly legible, recommended symbols for the compilation of tactile maps. We also examine generalization constraints and other design parameters that are necessary for the standardization of tactile mapping. Finally, we explore differences in tactile map design depending upon the selected production method. Over the years, many useful guidelines have been developed although they remain unknown to the wider audience. There is still a long way to go in creating a global standard for the design of tactile maps. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Maps have been a unique source of knowledge for centuries. Such historical documents provide invaluable information for analyzing the complex spatial transformation of landscapes over important time frames. This is particularly true for urban areas that encompass multiple interleaved research domains (social sciences, economy, etc.). The large amount and significant diversity of map sources call for automatic image processing techniques in order to extract the relevant objects under a vectorial shape. The complexity of maps (text, noise, digitization artifacts, etc.) has hindered the capacity of proposing a versatile and efficient raster-to-vector approaches for decades. We propose a learnable, reproducible, and reusable solution for the automatic transformation of raster maps into vector objects (building blocks, streets, rivers). It is built upon the complementary strength of mathematical morphology and convolutional neural networks through efficient edge filtering. Evenmore, we modify ConnNet and combine with deep edge filtering architecture to make use of pixel connectivity information and built an end-to-end system without requiring any post-processing techniques. In this paper, we focus on the comprehensive benchmark on various architectures on multiple datasets coupled with a novel vectorization step. Our experimental results on a new public dataset using COCO Panoptic metric exhibit very encouraging results confirmed by a qualitative analysis of the success and failure cases of our approach.

This task is evaluated on 3 large images containing hundreds of shapes to detect. Task 2 consists in segmenting map content from the larger map sheet, and was won by the UWB team using a U-Net-like FCN combined with a binarization method to increase detection edge accuracy. Task 3 consists in locating intersection points of geo-referencing lines, and was also won by the UWB team who used a dedicated pipeline combining binarization, line detection with Hough transform, candidate filtering, and template matching for intersection refinement.

An industrial event is described through several features as the event trigger, the industrial activity, the institution, the pollutant, etc. In order to efficiently collect information from a large corpus, it is necessary to automatize the information extraction process. To this end, we manually annotated a part of a corpus about soil industrial pollution, then we used it to train information extraction models with deep learning methods. The models we trained achieve 0.76 F-score on event feature extraction. We intend to improve the models and then use them on other text resources to enrich the polluted sites memory with extracted information about industrial events.

	abstract = {Neural Style Transfer is a Computer Vision topic intending to transfer the visual appearance or the style of images to other images. Developments in deep learning nicely generate stylized images from texture-based examples or transfer the style of a photograph to another one. In map design, the style is a multi-dimensional complex problem related to recognizable visual salient features and topological arrangements, supporting the description of geographic spaces at a specific scale. The map style transfer is still at stake to generate a diversity of possible new styles to render geographical features. Generative adversarial Networks (GANs) techniques, well supporting image-to-image translation tasks, offer new perspectives for map style transfer. We propose to use accessible GAN architectures, in order to experiment and assess neural map style transfer to ortho-images, while using different map designs of various geographic spaces, from simple-styled (Plan maps) to complex-styled (old Cassini, Etat-Major, or Scan50 B&W).

	abstract = {Time series of optical and Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) images provide complementary knowledge about the cover and use of the Earth surface since they exhibit information of distinct physical nature. They have proved to be particularly relevant for monitoring large areas with high temporal dynamics and related to significant ecosystem services. Grasslands are such crucial surfaces, both in terms of economic and environmental issues and the automatic and frequent monitoring of their agricultural practices is required for many purposes. To address this problem, the deep-based SenDVI framework is presented. SenDVI proposes an object-based methodology to estimate NDVI values from Sentinel-1 SAR observations and contextual knowledge (weather, terrain). Values are regressed every 6 days for compliance with monitoring purposes. Very satisfactory results are obtained with this low-level multimodal fusion strategy (R2&thinsp;Combining double low line&thinsp;0.84 on a Sentinel-2 tile). Finer analysis is however required to fully assess the relevance of each modality (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, weather, terrain) and feature sets and to propose the simplest conceivable framework. Results show that not all features are necessary and can be discarded while others have a mandatory contribution to the regression task. Moreover, experiments prove that accuracy can be improved by not saturating the network with non-essential information (among contextual knowledge in particular). This allows to move towards more operational solution. © 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.},

	abstract = {Along with a new volume of images containing valuable information about our past, the digitization of historical territorial imagery has brought the challenge of understanding and interconnecting collections with unique or rare representation characteristics, and sparse metadata. Content-based image retrieval offers a promising solution in this context, by building links in the data without relying on human supervision. However, while the latest propositions in deep learning have shown impressive results in applications linked to feature learning, they often rely on the hypothesis that there exists a training dataset matching the use case. Increasing generalization and robustness to variations remains an open challenge, poorly understood in the context of real-world applications. Introducing the ALEGORIA benchmark, containing multi-date vertical and oblique aerial digitized photography mixed with more modern street-level pictures, we formulate the problem of low-data, heterogeneous image retrieval, and propose associated evaluation setups and measures. We propose a review of ideas and methods to tackle this problem, extensively compare state-of-the-art descriptors and propose a new multi-descriptor diffusion method to exploit their comparative strengths. Our experiments highlight the benefits of combining descriptors and the compromise between absolute and cross-domain performance. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

We show that the problem can be tiled and distributed across a cloud or a cluster of PCs by paying a careful attention to the interactions between tiles and using Spark computing framework.

	abstract = {Foam is often present in satellite images of coastal areas and can lead to serious errors in the detection of shorelines especially when processing high spatial resolution images (<20 m). This study focuses on shoreline extraction and shoreline evolution using high spatial resolution satellite images in the presence of foam. A multispectral supervised classification technique is selected, namely the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and applied with three classes which are land, foam and water. The merging of water and foam classes followed by a segmentation procedure enables the separation of land and ocean pixels. The performance of the method is evaluated using a validation dataset acquired on two study areas (south and north of the bay of Sendaï-Japan). On each site, WorldView-2 multispectral images (eight bands, 2 m resolution) were acquired before and after the Fukushima tsunami generated by the Tohoku earthquake in 2011. The consideration of the foam class enables the false negative error to be reduced by a factor of three. The SVM method is also compared with four other classification methods, namely Euclidian Distance, Spectral Angle Mapper, Maximum Likelihood, and Neuronal Network. The SVM method appears to be the most efficient to determine the erosion and the accretion resulting from the tsunami, which are societal issues for littoral management purposes. © 2020 by the authors.},

Self-calibration reamains a main bottleneck for achieving the intrinsic value of historical imagery, as it involves certain underdeveloped research points such as detecting inter-epoch tie-points. In this research, we present a novel algorithm to detecting inter-epoch tie-points in historical images which do not rely on any auxiliary data. Using SIFT-detected keypoints we perform matching across epochs by interchangeably estimating and imposing that points follow two mathematical models: At first a 2D spatial similarity, then a 3D spatial similarity. We import GCPs to quantitatively evaluate our results with Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of differences (abbreviated as DoD) in absolute reference frame, and compare the results of our method with other 2 methods that use either the traditional SIFT or few <i>virtual</i> GCPs. The experiments show that far more correct inter-epoch tie-points can be extracted with our guided technique. Qualitative and quantitative results are reported. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

We produced forest loss maps every week over Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos (>750,000 km2 in total) using Sentinel-1 data. To do so, we used the forest loss detection method based on shadow detection. The main advantage of this method is the ability to avoid false alarms, which is relevant in Southeast Asia where the areas of forest disturbance may be very small and scattered and detection is used for alert purposes. The estimated user accuracy of the forest loss map was 0.95 for forest disturbances and 0.99 for intact forest, and the estimated producer’s accuracy was 0.90 for forest disturbances and 0.99 for intact forest, with a minimum mapping unit of 0.1 ha. This represents an important step forward compared to the values achieved by previous studies. We also found that approximately half of forest disturbances in Cambodia from 2018 to 2020 occurred in protected areas, which emphasizes the lack of efficiency in the protection and conservation of natural resources in protected areas. On an annual basis, the forest loss areas detected using our method are found to be similar to the estimations from Global Forest Watch. These results highlight the fact that this method provides not only quick alerts but also reliable detections that can be used to calculate weekly, monthly, or annual forest loss statistics at a national scale. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, we present the first end-to-end, single-stage method for panoptic segmentation of Satellite Image Time Series (SITS). This module can be combined with our novel image sequence encoding network which relies on temporal self-attention to extract rich and adaptive multi-scale spatio-temporal features. We also introduce PASTIS, the first open-access SITS dataset with panoptic annotations. We demonstrate the superiority of our encoder for semantic segmentation against multiple competing architectures, and set up the first state-of-the-art of panoptic segmentation of SITS. Our implementation and PASTIS are publicly available. © 2021 IEEE},

	abstract = {Radar data at C-band has shown great potential for the monitoring of soil and canopy hydric conditions of wheat crops. In this study, the C-band Sentinel-1 time series including the backscattering coefficients σ0 at VV and VH polarization, the polarization ratio (PR) and the interferometric coherence ρ are first analyzed with the support of experimental data gathered on three plots of irrigated winter wheat located in the Haouz plain in the center of Morocco covering five growing seasons. The results showed that ρ and PR are tightly related to the canopy development. ρ is also sensitive to soil preparation. By contrast, σ0 was found to be widely linked to changes in surface soil moisture (SSM) during the first growth stages when Leaf Area Index remains moderate (<1.5 m2/m2). In addition, drastic changes in the crop geometry associated to heading had a strong impact on the C-band σ0, in particular for VH polarization. The coupled water cloud and Oh models (WCM) were then calibrated and validated on the study sites. The comparison between the predicted and observed σ0 yielded a root mean square error (RMSE) values ranging from 1.50 dB to 2.02 dB for VV and between 1.74 dB to 2.52 dB for VH with significant differences occurring in the second part of the season after heading. Finally, new approaches based on the inversion of the WCM for SSM retrieval over wheat fields were proposed using Sentinel-1 radar data only. To this objective, the dry above-ground biomass (AGB) and the vegetation water content (VWC) were retrieved from the interferometric coherence and the PR. The relationships were then used as the vegetation descriptor in the WCM. The best retrieval results were obtained using the relationship between ρVV and the AGB (R and RMSE of 0.82, 0.05 m3/m3 respectively and no bias). The new retrieval approaches were then applied to a large database covering a rainfed field in Morocco and 18 plots of rainfed and irrigated wheat of the Kairouan plain (Tunisia) and compared to other classical techniques of SSM retrieval including simple linear relationships between SSM and σ0. The method based on the WCM and the ρVV-AGB relationships also provided with slightly better results than the others on the validation database (r = 0.75, RMSE = 0.06 m3/m3 and bias = 0.01 m3/m3 over the 18 plots of Tunisia) but the simple linear relationships performed also reasonably well (r = 0.62, RMSE = 0.07, bias = −0.01 in Tunisia for instance). This study opens perspectives for high resolution soil moisture mapping from Sentinel-1 data over south Mediterranean wheat crops and in fine, for irrigation scheduling and retrieval through the assimilation of these new products in an evapotranspiration model. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The Bay of Bonny, located along the Cameroon coastline, is home to diverse ecosystems. It is under significant pressure from large human activity, but remains very little studied, like much of the Gulf of Guinea. In order to understand its long-term shoreline variations and the role the wave regime plays in the evolution of the coastline, a study was conducted on the basis of optical image archives from Landsat 5∕7∕8 and Sentinel-2A/2B satellite missions acquired between October 1986 and May 2020, coupled with daily ERA-Interim wave re-analysis data covering the period from January 1986 to August 2019. Overall, the results show that the evolution of the coast is highly variable in space and time, as indicated by different levels of erosion (30.55 %), and accretion (27.7 %) on the decadal-scale, with the most significant variations occurring in estuarine areas. Nevertheless, 41.75% of the Cameroon shoreline remains stable during the study period. Three main periods (1986–1994; 1995–2005; 2006–2020) during which the coast underwent significant changes a different location were identified, reaching a retreat rate of up to −10 m/year in the northern section during the first period 1986–1994. The annual trend of significant wave heights anomaly along the coast (−5.6 to −4.1 mm/year) with wave height maxima estimated at 1.46 ± 0.65 m, where observed during the summer months (July–August). Monthly shoreline changes are inversely correlated with wave climate in some segments. Eigenvalue orthogonal decomposition analyses (Mode 1, Empirical Orthogonal Function) show that 76.3% of the observed variability would be due to the relatively strong local influence of erosion and accretion. This local influence can be related to wave regime at shorter timescale (monthly to seasonal) and the sediment variability from the source inland to the coast at longer timescale (seasonal to decadal). These observations explain a complex pattern of shoreline changes with an almost continuous retreat shoreline during the period 1986–2013 and a reversal in trend towards accretion during the period 2013–2020. EOF mode 2 explains 23.7% of variability, which can be potentially associated with the synergetic relationship between tidal currents and wave-induced longshore current, tidal currents and possibly pockets of human activity. This is attributed to an overall decrease in the supply of sediment via the coastal transport system that prevails in the Gulf of Guinea. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In this paper,we revisit the classical representation of 3D point clouds as linear shape models. Our key insight is to leverage deep learning to represent a collection of shapes as affine transformations of low-dimensional linear shape models. Each linear model is characterized by a shape prototype,a low-dimensional shape basis and two neural networks. The networks take as input a point cloud and predict the coordinates of a shape in the linear basis and the affine transformation which best approximate the input. Both linear models and neural networks are learned end-to-end using a single reconstruction loss. The main advantage of our approach is that,in contrast to many recent deep approaches which learn feature-based complex shape representations,our model is explicit and every operation occurs in 3D space. As a result,our linear shape models can be easily visualized and annotated,and failure cases can be visually understood. While our main goal is to introduce a compact and interpretable representation of shape collections,we show it leads to state of the art results for few-shot segmentation.

	abstract = {French Guiana forests cover 8 million hectares. With 98% of emerged land covered by forests, French Guiana is the area with the highest proportion of forest cover in the world. These forests are home to an exceptionally rich and diverse wealth of biodiversity that is both vulnerable and under threat due to high levels of pressure from human activity. As part of the French territory, French Guiana benefits from determined and continuous national efforts in the preservation of biodiversity and the environmental functionalities of ecosystems. The loss and fragmentation of forest cover caused by gold mining (legal and illegal), smallholder agriculture and forest exploitation, are considered as small-scale disturbances, although representing strong effects to vulnerable natural habitats, landscapes, and local populations. To monitor forest management programs and combat illegal deforestation and forest opening near-real time alerts system based on remote sensing data are required. For this large territory under frequent cloud cover, Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data appear to be the best adapted. In this paper, a method for forest alerts in a near-real time context based on Sentinel-1 data over the whole of French Guiana (83,534 km2) was developed and evaluated. The assessment was conducted for 2 years between 2016 and 2018 and includes comparisons with reference data provided by French Guiana forest organizations and comparisons with the existing University of Maryland Global Land Analysis and Discovery Forest Alerts datasets based on Landsat data. The reference datasets include 1,867 plots covering 2,124.5 ha of gold mining, smallholder agriculture and forest exploitation. The validation results showed high user accuracies (96.2%) and producer accuracies (81.5%) for forest loss detection, with the latter much higher than for optical forest alerts (36.4%). The forest alerts maps were also compared in terms of detection timing, showing systematic temporal delays of up to one year in the optical method compared to the SAR method. These results highlight the benefits of SAR over optical imagery for forest alerts detection in French Guiana. Finally, the potential of the SAR method applied to tropical forests is discussed.

The underlying challenge remains open: can we accurately classify new scenes on new datasets? In this paper, we propose a new framework for few-shot, cross-domain classification. Our retrieval-inspired approach1 exploits the interrelations in both the training and testing data to output class labels using compact descriptors.

	abstract = {Image indexing for lifelong localization is a key component for a large panel of applications, including robot navigation, autonomous driving or cultural heritage valorization. The principal difficulty in long-term localization arises from the dynamic changes that affect outdoor environments. In this work, we propose a new approach for outdoor large scale image-based localization that can deal with challenging scenarios like cross-season, cross-weather and day/night localization. The key component of our method is a new learned global image descriptor, that can effectively benefit from scene geometry information during training. At test time, our system is capable of inferring the depth map related to the query image and use it to increase localization accuracy. We show through extensive evaluation that our method can improve localization performances, especially in challenging scenarios when the visual appearance of the scene has changed. Our method is able to leverage both visual and geometric clues from monocular images to create discriminative descriptors for cross-season localization and effective matching of images acquired at different time periods. Our method can also use weakly annotated data to localize night images across a reference dataset of daytime images. Finally we extended our method to reflectance modality and we compare multi-modal descriptors respectively based on geometry, material reflectance and a combination of both. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Our model, making use of both local geometric attributes and line-of-sight visibility information, is able to learn a visibility model from a small amount of synthetic training data and generalizes to real-life acquisitions.

	abstract = {City modeling consists in building a semantic generalized model of the surface of urban objects. These could be seen as a special case of Boundary representation surfaces. Most modeling methods focus on 3D buildings with Very High Resolution overhead data (images and/or 3D point clouds). The literature abundantly addresses 3D mesh processing but frequently ignores the analysis of such models. This requires an efficient representation of 3D buildings. In particular, for them to be used in supervised learning tasks, such a representation should be scalable and transferable to various environments as only a few reference training instances would be available. In this paper, we propose two solutions that take into account the specificity of 3D urban models. They are based on graph kernels and Scattering Network. They are here evaluated in the challenging framework of quality evaluation of building models. The latter is formulated as a supervised multilabel classification problem, where error labels are predicted at building level. The experiments show for both feature extraction strategy strong and complementary results (F-score > 74% for most labels). Transferability of the classification is also examined in order to assess the scalability of the evaluation process yielding very encouraging scores (F-score>86% for most labels).  © 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

	abstract = {The Planet PlanetScope (PS) CubeSat constellation acquires high-resolution optical images that cover the entire surface of the Earth daily, enabling an unprecedented capability to monitor the Earth's surface changes. However, our analysis reveals artifacts of the geometry of PS images related to the imaging system and processing issues, limiting the usability of these data for various Earth science applications, including the monitoring of glaciers, dune motion, or the measurement of ground deformation due to earthquakes and landslides. Here, we analyze these artifacts and propose ways to remediate them. We use two examples to evaluate the data and assess the performance of our proposed approaches. The first is the ground deformation caused by the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence, California, USA, and the second is the 2018-2019 surge of the Shisper glacier in the Karakorum. Using an image correlation technique, we show that PS images exhibit several geometric artifacts, such as scene-to-scene misregistration, inconsistence geolocation accuracy between spectral bands, and topographic artifacts. Altogether, these artifacts make a quantitative analysis of ground displacement difficult and inaccurate. We present a method that remediates most of these geometric artifacts. In addition, we propose a framework for selecting the most appropriate images and a procedure for refining the rational function model (RFM) of unrectified images to monitor surface displacements and topography changes in 3-D. These tools should enhance the use of PS images for Earth science applications.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.},

The objective is to set a rigorous protocol measuring the quality of the reconstruction and to propose a quality metric that is informative with respect to the various qualities that such an algorithm should have, and in particular its capacity to interpolate and extrapolate accurately. Our approach aims at being more informative and rigorous than previous works on this topic. In addition, we use publicly available data and our implementation is open-source. We argue that a rigorous evaluation of surface reconstruction of open scenes needs to be performed on synthetic data where a perfect continuous ground truth surface is available, so we developed our own LiDAR simulator of which we give a description in the present paper.  © 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

Even if these images are taken during cloudless period, they are impaired by radiometric inhomogeneity mostly due to atmospheric phenomena, like hotspot, haze or high altitude clouds shadows as well as imaging device systematisms, like lens vignetting. These create some unsightly radiometric inhomogeneity in the orthophotomosaic that could be corrected by using a Wallis filter. Yet this solution leads to a significant loss of contrast at small scales.

Several automatic products have already been proposed, but are mostly generated out of satellite sensors like Sentinel-2 (S2) or Landsat. Metric sensors, e.g. SPOT-6/7, have been less considered, while they enable (at least annual) acquisitions at country scale and can now be efficiently processed thanks to deep learning (DL) approaches. This study thus aimed at assessing whether such sensor can improve such land cover products. A custom simple yet effective U-net-Deconv-Net inspired DL architecture is developed and applied to SPOT-6/7 and S2 for different LC nomenclatures, aiming at comparing the relevance of their spatial/spectral configurations and investigating their complementarity. The proposed DL architecture is then extended to data fusion and applied to previous sensors. At the end, the proposed fusion framework is used to enrich an existing S2 based LC product, as it is generic enough to cope with fusion at distinct levels. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

CLC is currently tediously produced each six years from both the visual interpretation and the automatic analysis of a large amount of remote sensing images. Observing that various European countries regularly produce in parallel their own land-cover country-scaled maps with their own specifications, we propose to directly infer CORINE Land-Cover from an existing map, therefore steadily decreasing the updating time-frame. No additional remote sensing image is required. In this paper, we focus more specifically on translating a country-scale remote sensed map, OSO (France), into CORINE Land Cover, in a supervised way. OSO and CLC not only differ in nomenclature but also in spatial resolution. We jointly harmonize both dimensions using a contextual and asymmetrical Convolution Neural Network with positional encoding. We show for various use cases that our method achieves a superior performance than the traditional semantic-based translation approach, achieving an 81% accuracy over all of France, close to the targeted 85% accuracy of CLC. © 2021 by the authors.

This work is interested in evaluating the impact of the anisotropic sky and the reflection of the building on the irradiance of shaded surfaces. The assessment is based on 3D radiative transfer simulations of urban scenes with different sky radiance distributions and different building façade reflectance. The results show that without taking into account anisotropic sky, the average error of sky irradiance estimation in cast shadows can reach 183.75% in a visible band centered at 550 nm. According to the geometry and reflectivity of the building façade, the contribution of the building reflection to the irradiance of the shaded surfaces varies from 0.95% to 84.23%. ©2021 IEEE},

	abstract = {Tactile cartography has always been a niche topic, but even among tactile cartographers, little attention has been paid to thematic tactile maps. Thematic maps are used in education and the lack of such materials makes it difficult to fulfill particular subjects’ curriculums. In this research, we propose a methodology for automatic compilation of legible and cartographically sound educational thematic tactile maps that bases on the concept of anchor layers and uses unequivocal parameters for generalization operators. Using such an approach we were able to automate the most complicated parts of the procedure that deal particularly with the generalization of geospatial data. We verify the proposed methodology by preparing a sample case study 3D printed map that is later evaluated by students with visual impairments. We also evaluate a novel approach of hybrid map production that consists of both graphic and tactile content. Our results suggest that the proposed methodology can be used for fast and repeatable production of fully fledged thematic tactile maps and that it forms a significant step toward completely automatic tactile maps development in the future. © 2022 The Author(s).

Then, we compare modern CNN- and Transformer-based NER techniques which can be reasonably used in the context of historical document analysis. We measure their requirements in terms of training data, the effects of OCR noise on their performance, and show how Transformer-based NER can benefit from unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning on noisy data.

	abstract = {In this paper, we describe a framework to find a good quality waste collection tour after a flood, without having to solve a complicated optimization problem from scratch in limited time. We model the computation of a waste collection tour as a capacitated routing problem, on the vertices or on the edges of a graph, with uncertain waste quantities and uncertain road availability. Multiple models have been conceived to manage uncertainty in routing problems, and we build on the ideas of discretizing the uncertain parameters and computing master solutions that can be adapted to propose an original method to compute efficient solutions. We first introduce our model for the progressive removal of the uncertainty, then outline our method to compute solutions: our method first considers a low-dimensional set of random variables that govern the behaviour of the problem parameters, discretizes these variables and computes a solution for each discrete point before the flood, and then uses these solutions as a basis to build operational solutions when there are enough information about the parameters of the routing problem. We then give computational tools to implement this method. We give a framework to compute the basis of solutions in an efficient way, by computing all the solutions simultaneously and sharing information (that can lead to good quality solutions) between the different problems based on how close their parameters are, and we also describe how real solutions can be derived from this basis. Our main contributions are our model for the progressive removal of uncertainty, our multi-step method to compute efficient solutions, and our intrusive framework to compute solutions on the discrete grid of parameters. © Copyright: Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {Stereo dense matching is a fundamental task for 3D scene reconstruction. Recently, deep learning based methods have proven effective on some benchmark datasets, for example Middlebury and KITTI stereo. However, it is not easy to find a training dataset for aerial photogrammetry. Generating ground truth data for real scenes is a challenging task. In the photogrammetry community, many evaluation methods use digital surface models (DSM) to generate the ground truth disparity for the stereo pairs, but in this case interpolation may bring errors in the estimated disparity. In this paper, we publish a stereo dense matching dataset based on ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, and use it to evaluate some traditional and deep learning based methods. The evaluation shows that learning-based methods outperform traditional methods significantly when the fine tuning is done on a similar landscape. The benchmark also investigates the impact of the base to height ratio on the performance of the evaluated methods.

	abstract = {Detecting planar structures in point clouds is a very central step of the point cloud processing pipeline as many Lidar scans, in particular in anthropic environments, present such planar structures. Many improvements have been proposed to RANSAC and the Hough transform, the two major types of plane detection methods. An important limitation however is that these methods detect planes running across the whole scene instead of more localized planar patches. Moreover, they do not exploit the sensor information that often comes with Lidar point cloud (sensor topology and optical center position in particular). In this paper we address both issues: We aim at detecting planar polygons that have a limited spatial extent, and we exploit sensor topology. The latter is used to enhance a RANSAC framework on two aspects: To make seed points selection more local and to define more compact sets of inliers through sensor space region growing. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

	abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have been used in various monitoring applications for the past two decades, as one of the very few options to provide absolute positions in a global reference frame. However, high performance GNSS stations are expensive, and sometimes may be impractical because of their size, power consumption or software requirements. Thus, the use of low-cost GNSS stations for structural health monitoring (SHM) has gained increasing attention. This paper presents a detailed experimental assessment of multiple combinations of GNSS receivers and antennas, and highlights an optimal cost-efficient solution for monitoring applications. Several sets of processing parameters and constraints are also evaluated using open source RTKLib software. The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated through two experimental dynamic scenarios, proving its ability to track quick displacements down to 4 mm and oscillations of 1 cm with a frequency up to 0.25 Hz with a 1 Hz receiver. Finally, a two-week dataset acquired from on a network of low-cost GNSS stations deployed on a suspended bridge is used to validate on-site performance. Results show good agreement between GNSS time series, traditional displacement sensors, and numerical simulations made using an operational mechanical model of the bridge, highlighting the potential of such low-cost solutions for structural health monitoring applications. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We hope to increase the ability of relevant stakeholders, including scientific communities working in that field, to handle the complexity of the current urban challenges. Culture is understood here in the broadest sense of the word, including the values and conceptualizations of the world, and the modes of technological creation and control of the environment. This concept of culture varies among stakeholders, depending, in particular, on their activities, on the place they live in, and also depending on their scientific background. We propose to complement existing targets that are explicitly related to culture in the UN and UNESCO agendas for 2030, and introduce a target of culture awareness for city information infrastructures. We show that, in the specific case of land patterns and land use, these new targets can be approached with historical data. Our analysis of the related core functionalities is based on interviews with practitioners, draws on insights from the humanities, and takes into account the readiness of the existing technologies. © 2021 by the authors.

First, both sources are classified individually in five classes, using state-of-the-art supervised classification approaches and Convolutional Neural Networks. Obtained results are merged in order to extract buildings as accurately as possible. Then, detected buildings are merged again with the S2 classification to extract urban area; a prior to be in an urban area is derived from these building objects and merged with a binary classification derived from the original S2 classification. Both fusions involve a per pixel decision level fusion followed by a contrast sensitive regularization. © 2018 IEEE},

By launching the Setinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites in the Copernicus program, the community now has free data with important time-revisits allowing the greatest number of people to effectively monitor land cover of a study area. This paper presents a land use monitoring method based on the combination of two approaches computed using Open Source tools (QGIS, Orfeo ToolBox, python). First, we focus on land use monitoring at an annual time scale using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, and then, by the use f entienl-1 data, we detect changes in the forest cover due to deforestation at bi-monthly time scale. The results obtained show a very good synergy of these approaches allowing the complementary of optical and radar data.

In this work we wanted to study the relationship between temporal interferometric coherence, radar backscattered coefficient and types of agricultural practices associated with grasslands such as grazing, mowing, and the mixed exploitation of these two practices. High coherence values due to backscattering from the ground were linked to ploughed bare fields and low vegetation height and the backscattering coefficient ro increases with the biomass up to a saturation level. Results revealed that grazing actions are easily detectable especially with the coherence values while mowing date cannot be clearly detected whether by coherence or by backscattered coefficient. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {Visual localization is a useful alternative to standard localization techniques. In a typical scenario, features are extracted from images captured by cameras and compared with geo-referenced databases. Location information is then inferred from the matching results. Conventional schemes mainly use low-level visual features. They offer good accuracy but suffer from scalability issues. In order to assist localization in large urban areas, this work explores a different path by utilizing high-level semantic information. It is found that object information in a street view can facilitate localization. A novel descriptor scheme called 'semantic signature' is proposed to summarize this information. A semantic signature consists of type and angle information of visible objects at a spatial location. Several metrics and protocols are proposed for signature comparison and retrieval. They illustrate different trade-offs between accuracy and complexity. Extensive simulation results confirm the potential of the proposed scheme in large-scale applications. © 2018 IEEE.},

These datasets require data integration, which implies linking homologous entities in a process called data matching that remains a challenging task, despite a quite substantial literature, because of data imperfections and heterogeneities. In this paper, we present an approach for matching spatial networks based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that takes full benefit of the underlying topology of networks. The approach is assessed using four heterogeneous datasets (streets, roads, railway, and hydrographic networks), showing that the HMM algorithm is robust in regards to data heterogeneities and imperfections (geometric discrepancies and differences in level of details) and adaptable to match any type of spatial networks. It also has the advantage of requiring no mandatory parameters, as proven by a sensitivity exploration, except a distance threshold that filters potential matching candidates in order to speed-up the process. Finally, a comparison with a commonly cited approach highlights good matching accuracy and completeness. © by the author(s).},

Our pose estimation method is two-step, we first retrieve an initial 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) location of an unknown-pose query by retrieving the most similar candidate in a pool of geo-referenced images. In a second time, we refine the query pose with a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm where the 3D points are obtained thanks to a generated depth map from the retrieved image candidate. We make our method fast and lightweight by using a common neural network architecture to generate the image descriptor for image indexing and the depth map used to create the 3D points required in the PnP pose refinement step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal through extensive experimentation on both indoor and outdoor scenes, as well as generalisation capability of our method to unknown environment. Finally, we show how to deploy our system even if geometric information is missing to train our monocular-image-to-depth neural networks. © 2019.

Finally, we formulate point cloud oversegmentation as a graph partition problem with respect to the learned embeddings. This new approach allows us to set a new state-of-the-art in point cloud oversegmentation by a significant margin, on a dense indoor dataset (S3DIS) and a sparse outdoor one (vKITTI). Our best solution requires over five times fewer superpoints to reach similar performance than previously published methods on S3DIS. Furthermore, we show that our framework can be used to improve superpoint-based semantic segmentation algorithms, setting a new state-of-the-art for this task as well. © 2019 IEEE.},

Another major interest of such sensor deployment is to densify the air quality monitoring network, indoor, as in the outdoor, which is today restricted to sparse nodes. However, this high spatiotemporal resolution raises several issues related to their analysis.

In this context, the method developed in this study, named (Geographic Information System) for Environmental Monitoring in Wartime, can be used to calculate a risk indicator for environmental degradation, spatial monitoring and risk management. This will make it possible to identify the main threats to protected areas, catalogue the damage caused to the environment by armed conflicts and create a dynamic risk map. In this paper, GIS-EMW has been applied to calculate a risk indicator for environmental degradation in Syria. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

These applications may meet everyday needs, such as calculating itineraries, or complex issues, such as land management or the assessment of scenarios. This chapter suggests a way to categorize the various sources of imperfection in geographic information that maintains the classic distinction between different phases or processes (from the collection of data to its use). It shows through which components (initial source, target model, measuring tool, procedure, and operator) imperfections may find their way into the five classic processes that characterize the life cycle of geographic data. The chapter demonstrates that these imperfections concern various dimensions (semantic, geometric, and temporal) and different types (vector, raster) of geographic data. © ISTE Ltd 2019.},

	abstract = {Mapping applications display multi-scale maps where zooming in and out triggers the display of different maps at different scales. Multi-scale maps strongly augmented the potential uses of maps, compared to the traditional single-scaled paper maps. But the exploration of the multi-scale maps can be cognitively difficult for users because the content of the maps can be very different at different scales. This paper seeks to identify the factors in the design of map content and style that increase or decrease the exploration cognitive load, in order to improve multi-scales map design. We studied sixteen existing examples of multi-scale maps to identify these factors that influence a fluid zooming interaction. Several different analyses were conducted on these sixteen multi-scale maps. We first conducted a guided visual exploration of the maps, and a detailed study of the scales of the maps, to identify general trends of good practices (e.g. the WMTS standard that defines zoom levels is widely used) and potential ways of improvement (e.g. a same map is often used at multiple successive zoom levels). Then, we focused on the visual complexity of the multi-scale maps by analyzing how it varies, continuously or not, across scales, using clutter measures, which showed a peak of complexity at zoom level 12 of the WMTS standard. Finally, we studied how buildings and roads are subject to abstraction changes across scales (e.g. at what zoom level individual buildings turn into built-up areas), which can be one of the causes of exploration difficulties. We identified some good practices to reduce the impact of abstraction changes, for instance by mixing different levels of abstraction in the same map. © 2020 International Cartographic Association.},

	abstract = {In this study, the potential of Sentinel-1 data to seasonally monitor temperate forests was investigated by analyzing radar signatures observed from plots in the Fontainebleau Forest of the Ile de France region, France, for the period extending from March 2015 to January 2016. Radar backscattering coefficients, σ0 and the amplitude of temporal interferometric coherence profiles in relation to environmental variables are shown, such as in situ precipitation and air temperature. The high temporal frequency of Sentinel-1 acquisitions (i.e., twelve days, or six, if both Sentinel-1A and B are combined over Europe) and the dual polarization configuration (VV and VH over most land surfaces) made a significant contribution. In particular, the radar backscattering coefficient ratio of VV to VH polarization, σV V                             0/σV H                             0, showed a well-pronounced seasonality that was correlated with vegetation phenology, as confirmed in comparison to NDVI profiles derived from Landsat-8 (r = 0.77) over stands of deciduous trees. These results illustrate the high potential of Sentinel-1 data for monitoring vegetation, and as these data are not sensitive to the atmosphere, the phenology could be estimated with more accuracy than optical data. These observations will be quantitatively analyzed with the use of electromagnetic models in the near future. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Land use and land cover (LULC) mapping is often undertaken by national mapping agencies, where these LULC products are used for different types of monitoring and reporting applications. Updating of LULC databases is often done on a multi-year cycle due to the high costs involved, so changes are only detected when mapping exercises are repeated. Consequently, the information on LULC can quickly become outdated and hence may be incorrect in some areas. In the current era of big data and Earth observation, change detection algorithms can be used to identify changes in urban areas, which can then be used to automatically update LULC databases on a more continuous basis. However, the change detection algorithm must be validated before the changes can be committed to authoritative databases such as those produced by national mapping agencies. This paper outlines a change detection algorithm for identifying construction sites, which represent ongoing changes in LU, developed in the framework of the LandSense project. We then use volunteered geographic information (VGI) captured through the use of mapathons from a range of different groups of contributors to validate these changes. In total, 105 contributors were involved in the mapathons, producing a total of 2778 observations. The 105 contributors were grouped according to six different user-profiles and were analyzed to understand the impact of the experience of the users on the accuracy assessment. Overall, the results show that the change detection algorithm is able to identify changes in residential land use to an adequate level of accuracy (85%) but changes in infrastructure and industrial sites had lower accuracies (57% and 75 %, respectively), requiring further improvements. In terms of user profiles, the experts in LULC from local authorities, researchers in LULC at the French national mapping agency (IGN), and first-year students with a basic knowledge of geographic information systems had the highest overall accuracies (86.2%, 93.2%, and 85.2%, respectively). Differences in how the users approach the task also emerged, e.g., local authorities used knowledge and context to try to identify types of change while those with no knowledge of LULC (i.e., normal citizens) were quicker to choose 'Unknown' when the visual interpretation of a class was more difficult. © 2020, by the authors.},

	abstract = {Traces collected by citizens using GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) devices during sports activities such as running, hiking or biking are now widely available through different sport-oriented collaborative websites. The traces are collected by citizens for their own purposes and frequently shared with the sports community on the internet. Our research assumption is that crowdsourced GNSS traces may be a valuable source of information to detect updates in authoritative datasets. Despite their availability, the traces present some issues such as poor metadata, attribute incompleteness and heterogeneous positional accuracy. Moreover, certain parts of the traces (GNSS points composing the traces) are results of the displacements made out of the existing paths. In our context (i.e., update authoritative data) these off path GNSS points are considered as noise and should be filtered. Two types of noise are examined in this research: Points representing secondary activities (e.g., having a lunch break) and points representing errors during the acquisition. The first ones we named secondary human behaviour (SHB), whereas we named the second ones outliers. The goal of this paper is to improve the smoothness of traces by detecting and filtering both SHB and outliers. Two methods are proposed. The first one allows for the detection secondary human behaviour by analysing only traces geometry. The second one is a rule-based machine learning method that detects outliers by taking into account the intrinsic characteristics of points composing the traces, as well as the environmental conditions during traces acquisition. The proposed approaches are tested on crowdsourced GNSS traces collected in mountain areas during sports activities. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {                             This paper presents a fully automatic framework for the generation of so-called LiDAR orthoimages (i.e. 2D raster maps of the reflectance and height LiDAR samples) from ground-level LiDAR scans. Beyond the Digital Surface Model (DSM or heightmap) provided by the height orthoimage, the proposed method cost-effectively generates a reflectance channel that is easily interpretable by human operators without relying on any optical acquisition, calibration and registration. Moreover, it commonly achieves very high resolutions (1cm                             2                              per pixel), thanks to the typical sampling density of static or mobile LiDAR scans. Compared to orthoimages generated from aerial datasets, the proposed LiDAR orthoimages are acquired from the ground level and thus do not suffer occlusions from hovering objects (trees, tunnels and bridges), enabling their use in a number of urban applications such as road network monitoring and management, as well as precise mapping of the public space e.g. for accessibility applications or management of underground networks. Its generation and usability however faces two issues: (i) the inhomogeneous sampling density of LiDAR point clouds and (ii) the presence of masked areas (holes) behind occluders, which include, in a urban context, cars, tree trunks, poles or pedestrians (i) is addressed by first projecting the point cloud on a 2D-pixel grid so as to generate sparse and noisy reflectance and height images from which dense images estimated using a joint anisotropic diffusion of the height and reflectance channels. (ii) LiDAR shadow areas are detected by analyzing the diffusion results so that they can be inpainted using an examplar-based method, guided by an alignment prior. Results on real mobile and static acquisition data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline in generating a very high resolution LiDAR orthoimage of reflectance and height while filling holes of various sizes in a visually satisfying way.                          © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) launched in 2010, covers an area of 2,500 km x 2,500 km centered on the Korean peninsula, including the Japanese area and provides 8 images per day allowing the analysis of rapid changes that can occur during the day. Corrected from the atmospheric effect, the images were used to estimate the SPM concentrations maps. These maps were then analyzed between 5 March and 25 May 2011. The SPM notably increased (by 250 %) both along the coast and in the Bay of Sendai shortly after the tsunami and stable structures of SPM appeared at 2, 14, 25 and 37 km from the coast. In this paper we attempt to explain the origin and the fate of the SPM concentration observed till the end of May 2011 through analysis of meteorological conditions, river discharges and tsunami waves properties. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The relation between slip at the near surface and at depth during earthquakes is still not fully resolved at the moment. This deficiency leads to large uncertainties in the evaluation of the magnitude of past earthquakes based on surface observations, which is the only accessible evidence for such events. A better knowledge of the way slip distributes over distinct rupture strands within the first few kilometers from the surface would contribute greatly to reduce these uncertainties. The 30 October 2016 Mw6.5 Norcia earthquake has been captured by a variety of geodetic techniques, which provide access to the slip distribution both at depth and at the ground surface, with an unprecedented level of detail for a normal-faulting earthquake. We first present coseismic surface offset measurements from correlation of optical satellite images of submetric resolution, which are compared to field observations made shortly after the earthquake. Based on a joint inversion of optical data together with InSAR and GPS data, we then propose a rupture model that explains the observations both at far-field and near-field scales. Finally, we explore different rupture geometries at shallow depth, in an attempt to better explain the near-field deformation (i.e., within the first hundreds of meters around the fault) observed at the surface. Despite the fact that the solution is not unique, several lines of evidence suggest that gravity processes could be locally involved, which interfere with the dominant tectonic processes. © 2020.

In France, each regions, the first subnational administrative level, identified existing habitat patches and corridors in their territories using flexible guidelines. This resulted in heterogeneous data, raising the question of their consistent mapping at a supra-regional level. To answer this question, this study first focuses on the habitat patches of two adjacent regions and explores three ways of homogenizing the map. The first method consists in generalizing the more detailed data using morphologic operators. The second method consists in graphically refining the less detailed data by filling the areas with patterns taken from the more detailed data. The third method consists in drastically changing the level of abstraction of the data from both regions by rasterizing the space. Based on those experiments, we applied the most appropriate method to data collected by all the regions of continental France, a step which itself raises new issues concerning data harmonization and parameters settings. © 2020 International Cartographic Association.},

	abstract = {Cities are particularly vulnerable to meteorological hazards because of the concentration of population, goods, capital stock and infrastructure. Urban climate services require multi-disciplinary and multi-sectorial approaches and new paradigms in urban climate modelling. This paper classifies the required urban input data for both mesoscale state-of-the-art Urban Canopy Models (UCMs) and microscale Obstacle Resolving Models (ORM) into five categories and reviews the ways in which they can be obtained. The first two categories are (1) land cover, and (2) building morphology. These govern the main interactions between the city and the urban climate and the Urban Heat Island. Interdependence between morphological parameters and UCM geometric hypotheses are discussed. Building height, plan and wall area densities are recommended as the main input variables for UCMs, whereas ORMs require 3D building data. Recently, three other categories of urban data became relevant for finer urban studies and adaptation to climate change: (3) building design and architecture, (4) building use, anthropogenic heat and socio-economic data, and (5) urban vegetation data. Several methods for acquiring spatial information are reviewed, including remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS) processing from administrative cadasters, expert knowledge and crowdsourcing. Data availability, data harmonization, costs/efficiency trade-offs and future challenges are then discussed. © 2019},

At the same time, several academic or institutional sites offer explanatory resources (courses, software tutorials) on general or targeted topics intended to facilitate the use of images in most fields of application. In this paper, we wish to address and detail a particular point; that of the physical concept of the radar measurement, through the various software processing proposed during a sequence of georeferencing-calibration of the images. This sequence, which combines geometrical and radiometric aspects, is found for applications relating to the characterization of the various media present on the surface of the ground or to facilitate the analysis of temporal sequences. After presenting the general aspects related to the power measured at the sensor and the various factors influencing this measurement, we will focus on the user practice, by discussing the different choices of coefficients p°, a0, y°, offered during a calibration following a geo-referencing, as well as on the taking into account, or not, slope effects in geometric and radiometric corrections affecting the image. Particular attention is paid to the coefficient f whose variations as a function of local incidence are considered very low in the case of dense forests. © 2019 Soc.

This study employed ISO approach for camera pose determination with the objective of investigating the impact of a good sensor pre-calibration on a poor acquisition geometry. Within the presented works, several flights were conducted on a dike by a small UAV embedded with a metric camera and a GNSS receiver. The multi-lever-arm estimation within the BBA procedure makes it possible to merge image blocks of different configurations such as nadir and oblique images without physical constraints on camera and GNSS antenna positions. The merged image block achieves a better accuracy and the sensor self-calibrated well. The issued sensor calibration is then applied to a less preferable acquisition configuration and the accuracy is significantly improved. For a corridor acquisition scene of about 600 m, a centimetric accuracy is reached with one GCP. With the provided sensor pre-calibration, an accuracy of 3.9 cm is achieved without any GCP. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Our approach allows for the automatic integration of temporal knowledge, i.e., crop rotations using existing parcel-based land cover databases and multi-modal Sentinel-1 and -2 time series. The temporal evolution of crop types was modeled with a linearchain conditional random field, trained with time series of multi-modal (radar and optical) satellite acquisitions and associated LPIS. Our model was tested on two study areas in France (≥ 1250 km2) which show different crop types, various parcel sizes, and agricultural practices:.the Seine et Marne and the Alpes de Haute-Provence classified accordingly to a fine national 25-class nomenclature. We first trained a Random Forest classifier without temporal structure to achieve 89.0% overall accuracy in Seine et Marne (10 classes) and 73% in Alpes de Haute-Provence (14 classes). We then demonstrated experimentally that taking into account the temporal structure of crop rotation with our model resulted in an increase of 3% to +5% in accuracy. This increase was especially important (+12%) for classes which were poorly classified without using the temporal structure. A stark positive impact was also demonstrated on permanent crops, while it was fairly limited or even detrimental for annual crops. © 2020 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.},

	abstract = {Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) are a key asset for Europe. This paper concentrates on unsolved issues in SDIs in Europe related to the management of semantic heterogeneities. It studies contributions and competences from two communities in this field: cartographers, authoritative data providers, and geographic information scientists on the one hand, and computer scientists working on the Web of Data on the other. During several workshops organized by the EuroSDR and Eurogeographics organizations, the authors analyzed their complementarity and discovered reasons for the difficult collaboration between these communities. They have different and sometimes conflicting perspectives on what successful SDIs should look like, as well as on priorities. We developed a proposal to integrate both perspectives, which is centered on the elaboration of an open European Geographical Knowledge Graph. Its structure reuses results from the literature on geographical information ontologies. It is associated with a multifaceted roadmap addressing interrelated aspects of SDIs. © 2020 by the authors.},

Our main contribution is the formulation of the piecewise-planar approximation problem as a non-convex optimization problem.

However, no hyperspectral-unmixing based studies have been conducted to automatically detect photovoltaic panels, which represent one of the important components of energy systems in such areas. In this paper, a hyperspectral-unmixing based method is proposed to detect photovoltaic panels and to estimate their areas. This approach is based on an original multiplicative nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm with some known photovoltaic panel spectra. The proposed method can be considered as a partial/informed NMF approach. Experiments are conducted on realistic synthetic and real data to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. In both cases, obtained results show that the proposed method yields much better overall performance than a method from the literature. © 2018 IEEE},

The goal of this paper is to study the potential of crowdsourced traces coming from GPS devices to highlight updates in authoritative geographic data. To reach this goal, an approach based on two steps is proposed. First, a data matching method is applied to match authoritative data and crowdsourced traces. Second, for the non-matched crowdsourced segments composing a trace, different criteria are defined to decide if whether or not, non-matched segments should be considered as an alert for update in authoritative data. The proposed approach is tested on crowdsourced traces and on BDTOPO® authoritative road and path network in mountain area. The results are promising: 727, 1Â km of missing paths were found in the test area, which corresponds to 7.7% of the total length of used traces. The discovered missing paths also represent a contribution of 2.4% of the total length of BDTopo® road and path network in the test area. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

Very recent literature has shown the superior performance of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for many tasks, from object recognition to semantic labelling, including the classification of Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite images. However, while plethora of works aim at improving object delineation on geographically restricted areas, few tend to solve this classification task at very large scales. New issues occur such as intra-class class variability, diachrony between surveys, and the appearance of new classes in a specific area, that do not exist in the predefined set of labels. Therefore, this work intends to (i) perform large scale classification and to (ii) expand a set of land-cover classes, using the off-the-shelf model learnt in a specific area of interest and adapting it to unseen areas. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Different forms of phase noise in SAR interferograms hamper the accuracy and reliability of interferometric results (InSAR and DInSAR) for the reconstruction of altimetric information and its variations. Geometric and temporal decorrelations, changes in the properties of observed surfaces and delays introduced by the atmospheric layers are the main sources of interferometric noise. In order to reduce their effects and thus increase the robustness of the phase unwrapping algorithms, filtering methods are applied at different levels of the InSAR and DInSAR processes. In this article, we propose an interferometric filtering process that combines wavelet decomposition into subbands and nonlinear weighting filter called spectral contextual filter (SCF). SCF is based on the Goldstein algorithm, whose nonlinear filter coefficients are calculated, for each element of window according to the filter's punctual parameter. This parameter is determined by estimating the adaptive coherent pseudocorrelation of overlapping blocks of the interferometric phase which combines coherence and pseudocorrelation that are both weighted by the coefficient of variation of each block. In order to show the efficiency and robustness of this process, we compared it with the subspaces decomposition filtering process that we implemented. An assessment scheme was led on the basis of a compromise between residues reduction and fringe boundaries conservation. This assessment was carried relative to the global and local parameters. The tests were conducted on complex interferograms acquired on regions with high topographical variations. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Incorporating Human Visual System (HVS) models into building of classifiers has become an intensively researched field in visual content mining. In the variety of models of HVS we are interested in so-called visual saliency maps. Contrarily to scan-paths they model instantaneous attention assigning the degree of interestingness/saliency for humans to each pixel in the image plane. In various tasks of visual content understanding, these maps proved to be efficient stressing contribution of the areas of interest in image plane to classifiers models. In previous works saliency layers have been introduced in Deep CNNs, showing that they allow reducing training time getting similar accuracy and loss values in optimal models. In case of large image collections efficient building of saliency maps is based on predictive models of visual attention. They are generally bottom-up and are not adapted to specific visual tasks. Unless they are built for specific content, such as »urban images»-targeted saliency maps we also compare in this paper. In present research we propose a »bootstrap» strategy of building visual saliency maps for particular tasks of visual data mining. A small collection of images relevant to the visual understanding problem is annotated with gaze fixations. Then the propagation to a large training dataset is ensured and compared with the classical GBVS model and a recent method of saliency for urban image content. The classification results within Deep CNN framework are promising compared to the purely automatic visual saliency prediction. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Estimating visibility in point clouds has many applications such as visualization, surface reconstruction and scene analysis through fusion of LiDAR point clouds and images. However, most current works rely on methods that require strong assumptions on the point cloud density, which are not valid for LiDAR point clouds acquired from mobile mapping systems, leading to low quality of point visibility estimations. This work presents a novel approach for the estimation of the visibility of a point cloud from a viewpoint. The method is designed to be fully automatic and it makes no assumption on the point cloud density. The visibility of each point is estimated by considering its screen-space neighborhood from the given viewpoint. Our results show that our approach succeeds better in estimating the visibility on real-world data acquired using LiDAR scanners. We evaluate our approach by comparing its results to a new manually annotated dataset, which we make available online. Copyright © 2019 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

	abstract = {Many mass sources within the Earth and its fluid envelopes show elongated geometries, aligning with the orientations of plate boundaries and plate motions, coastlines, rivers, and drainage basins for instance. To enhance their identification and separation in global or regional gravity observations and models, a dedicated method based on gravitational gradients analysis is presented here. This approach provides a detailed description of the geographic pattern of the gravity variations, which are accurately mapped thanks to the regular spatial coverage of high-accuracy satellite data and arise from lateral density changes within the planet. First, gravity gradients are defined at different spatial scales in spherical frames, which are rotated along the radial axis according to the orientation of the source. The sensitivity of these gradients to the mass distribution inside a spherical Earth is described and analytical expressions relating the source to the observable are introduced. Then, the gravity gradients responses at different spatial scales to flat, elementary mass sources located at the surface and at increasing depth are studied. Specifically, the paper investigates how a source width and orientation can be determined, for localized and oscillatory mass anomalies with different width-to-length aspect ratios. This theoretical case study aims at providing a basis for the analysis of more complex mass structures, when applying the presented method to static or time-varying satellite gravity field models. It may help deciphering the nature of the gravity sources by the detection of meaningful geometries and orientations in the gravity field. ©2018. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {The theory of general relativity was born more than one hundred years ago, and since the beginning has striking prediction success. The gravitational redshift effect discovered by Einstein must be taken into account when comparing the frequencies of distant clocks. However, instead of using our knowledge of the Earth’s gravitational field to predict frequency shifts between distant clocks, one can revert the problem and ask if the measurement of frequency shifts between distant clocks can improve our knowledge of the gravitational field. This is known as chronometric geodesy. Since the beginning of the atomic time era in 1955, the accuracy and stability of atomic clocks were constantly ameliorated, with around one order of magnitude gained every ten years. Now that the atomic clock accuracy reaches the low 10 - 18 in fractional frequency, and can be compared to this level over continental distances with optical fibres, the accuracy of chronometric geodesy reaches the cm level and begins to be competitive with classical geodetic techniques such as geometric levelling and GNSS/geoid levelling. Moreover, the building of global timescales requires now to take into account these effects to the best possible accuracy. In this chapter we explain how atomic clock comparisons and the building of timescales can benefit from the latest developments in physical geodesy for the modelization and realization of the geoid, as well as how classical geodesy could benefit from this new type of observable, which are clock comparisons that are directly linked to gravity potential differences. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The main purpose is to reproduce contributor’s interactions in a more comprehensive way. First, we define a multigraph that combines existing spatial collaboration networks from the literature with new graphs that illustrate collaboration based on specific aspects of the VGI modes of contribution through semantics, geometry and topology. Indeed, the ways that contributors interact with one another through editing, completion, or even consumption may provide additional information on each user’s operation mode and therefore, on the quality of the contributed data. Social collaborations drawn from indirect criteria–for example, comparisons between contributors’ activity areas–can also be contemplated under another network. Second, the resulting multigraph is analysed using data mining approaches to characterise individuals and identify behavioural groups. The implementation of a multiplex network based on an OSM data sample and an initial analysis make it possible to identify useful behaviours for data qualification. The initial results characterise some contributors as pioneers, moderators and truthful contributors, according to their special roles in the graphs. Mapping elements that include these contributors’ participation are likely to be reliable data. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The recent availability of high spatial and temporal resolution optical and radar satellite imagery has dramatically increased opportunities for mapping land cover at fine scales. Fusion of optical and radar images has been found useful in tropical areas affected by cloud cover because of their complementarity. However, the multitemporal dimension these data now offer is often neglected because these areas are primarily characterized by relatively low levels of seasonality and because the consideration of multitemporal data requires more processing time. Hence, land cover mapping in these regions is often based on imagery acquired for a single date or on an average of multiple dates. The aim of this work is to assess the added value brought by the temporal dimension of optical and radar time series when mapping land cover in tropical environments. Specifically, we compared the accuracies of classifications based on (a) optical time series, (b) their temporal average, (c) radar time series, (d) their temporal average, (e) a combination of optical and radar time series and (f) a combination of their temporal averages for mapping land cover in Jambi province, Indonesia, using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. Using the full information contained in the time series resulted in significantly higher classification accuracies than using temporal averages (+14.7% for Sentinel-1, +2.5% for Sentinel-2 and +2% combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2). Overall, combining Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 time series provided the highest accuracies (Kappa = 88.5%). Our study demonstrates that preserving the temporal information provided by satellite image time series can significantly improve land cover classifications in tropical biodiversity hotspots, improving our capacity to monitor ecosystems of high conservation relevance such as peatlands.

Sentinel-1 satellites provide regular Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) acquisitions that are potentially useful to monitor these areas, but they can be affected by temporal decorrelation due to rapid changes in the surface. The application of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) therefore seems difficult due to loss of coherence. On the other hand, Corner Reflectors (CR) can be used as coherent targets in SAR images for accurate displacement measurement thanks to their strong backscattering property and temporal stability. The use of CRs in multi-temporal InSAR analysis in Alpine mountain areas can thus be beneficial. In this study, we present a comparison between triangular and rectangular CRs, based on Radar Cross Section (RCS) measurements in an anechoic chamber and on long-term experiments over the Argentière glacier and the surrounding slopes and moraine. The visibility in both summer and winter of 10 CRs installed on the test site was investigated. As this area is exposed to heavy precipitation including snow falls, two perforated CRs were tested. The amplitude stability and the phase error of each CR were estimated. A precise tracking of two CRs installed at the glacier surface was also able to measure the displacement of the Argentière glacier, giving results close to previous GPS measurements. Furthermore, a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) study was conducted, using the most stable CR as reference point to estimate slope instabilities, which led to the identification of an area corresponding to a tectonic fault called "Faille de l'angle". The precise absolute locations of the CRs were successfully estimated and PS heights were compared with a LiDAR-based (Light Detection And Ranging) digital elevation model (DEM) and GPS measurements. © 2019 by the authors.},

Results show that the interferometric coherence is sensitive to wheat biomass while the backscatter intensity is more influenced by the surface soil moisture (SSM) changes. A new method to retrieve SSM combining the interferometric coherence and C-band backscattering coefficient acquired by Sentinel-1 is tested over two irrigated wheat plots during two growth seasons around Marrakech city (center of Morocco). It is shown that SSM can be estimated with a reasonable accuracy from sowing to harvest (R=0.65; RMSE =0.07 m3m3; bias =0.01 m3m3).

	abstract = {The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster that occurred on March 11, 2011, was caused by the Tōhoku tsunami, which was itself triggered by the devastating 9.0 Mw moment magnitude earthquake. This study investigates spatial and temporal changes of the suspended particulate matter (SPM) content in the North-Eastern part of Japan (Pacific Ocean) using a geostationary ocean color sensor. The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), which is centered on the Korean peninsula but could also observe the Japanese area, is able to acquire eight images per day, thus allowing the analysis of rapid daily changes in water mass. The analysis of GOCI data shows that SPM concentration notably increased both along the coast and within the Bay of Sendaï shortly after the tsunami. Motionless patterns of SPM were observed at 2, 14, 25, and 37 km from the coast. It is shown that SPM concentration rapidly decreased one month later. The SPM concentration did not remain high the following year, contrary to what was observed for the Sumatra Tsunami in 2004. The origin of SPM is also investigated in this study. Our analysis suggests that some of the SPM originates from the resuspension of bottom sediments due to the reflection of the tsunami on the coastline that leads to the migration of marine particles toward the sea surface. The fate of the SPM concentration is then discussed based on the analysis of meteorological conditions, river discharge, and tsunami wave properties. © 2018 IEEE.},

It is cast as a supervised classification task based on a hierarchical taxonomy and multimodal handcrafted features (building geometry, optical images, height data). In this paper, we evaluate how the urban area composition impacts prediction transferability and scalability of our framework to unseen scenes.

Discriminating these seasonal signals from other sources of deformation in geodetic measurements is essential to isolate tectonic signals and to monitor spatio-temporal variations in continental water storage. We propose a new methodology to identify and extract these seasonal signals. The approach uses a variational Bayesian Independent Component Analysis (vbICA) to extract the seasonal signals and a gravity-based deformation model to identify which of these signals are caused by surface loading. We test the procedure on two study areas, the Arabian Peninsula and the Nepal Himalaya, and find that the technique successfully extracts the seasonal signals with one or two independent components, depending on whether the load is stationary or moving. The approach is robust to spatial heterogeneities inherent to geodetic measurements and can help extract systematic errors in geodetic products (e.g., draconitic errors). We also discuss how to handle the degree-1 deformation field present in the geodetic data set but not captured by the gravity-based model. ©2018. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

In order to reach this goal, we focus on and implement four elementary in situ and ex situ AR/MR experiments: Each type of these AR/MR experiments helps to consider and specify a specific subproblem, i.e. scale modification, pose estimation, matching between scene and urban project realism, and the mix of real and virtual elements through portals, while proposing occlusion handling, rendering and interaction techniques to solve them. © 2018 Auhtors.},

The objective was to link the satellite spectro-temporal data to the plant diversity indices. Among the several diversity indices tested, Simpson and Shannon indices were best predicted with a coefficient of determination around 0.4 using a Random Forest predictor and Sentinel-2 data. The use of Sentinel-1 data was not found to improve significantly the prediction accuracy. Using the Random Forest algorithm and the Sentinel-2 time series, the prediction of the Simpson index was performed.

	abstract = {Cartographic generalization research has focused almost exclusively in recent years on topographic mapping, and has thereby gained an incorrect reputation for having to do only with reference or positional data. The generalization research community needs to broaden its scope to include thematic cartography and geovisualization. Generalization is not new to these areas of cartography, and has in fact always been involved in thematic geographic visualization, despite rarely being acknowledged. We illustrate this involvement with several examples of famous, public-audience thematic maps, noting the generalization procedures involved in drawing each, both across their basemap and thematic layers. We also consider, for each map example we note, which generalization operators were crucial to the formation of the map’s thematic message. The many incremental gains made by the cartographic generalization research community while treating reference data can be brought to bear on thematic cartography in the same way they were used implicitly on the well-known thematic maps we highlight here as examples. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Extracting information from a polarimetric radar representation usually consists in decomposing it with target decomposition algorithms. This first step can be seen as a geometric analysis of the polarimetric information: The identification of physical radar scattering mechanisms. The problem is that average physical parameters are estimated. As a consequence, these parameters might not describe correctly any of the land cover types that can be mixed together into the radar resolution cell. Therefore, using the polarimetric parameters for land cover classification is challenging. The novelty of the method is to propose a thematic analysis of the polarimetric information preceding the geometric one. The objective is to assess if splitting off polarimetric information on a land cover type basis before applying usual target decomposition algorithms can produce more consistent radar scattering mechanisms when land cover classes are mixed inside the radar resolution cell. A cooperative fusion framework in which very high-resolution optical images are used to unmix physical radar scattering mechanisms is proposed. For bare soil and forests, we point out that a linear unmixing model applied to the covariance matrix is able to split off polarimetric information on a land cover type basis. The assessment of the unmixed radar matrices is carried out with polarimetric radar images from the Radarsat-2 satellite. It was found that despite speckle, the reconstructed radar information after the unmixing process is statistically relevant with the observations. The question whether the unmixed radar images contain relevant thematic information is more challenging, but results tend to validate this property. This method could be used to have a better estimation of vegetation biomass in the context of open forested areas. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the needs of a scalable out-of-core surface reconstruction algorithm available on the cloud, this paper addresses the computation of distributed Delaunay triangulations of massive point sets. The proposed algorithm takes as input a point cloud and first partitions it across multiple processing elements into tiles of relatively homogeneous point sizes. The distributed computation and communication between processing elements is orchestrated so that each one discovers the Delaunay neighbors of its input points within the theoretical overall Delaunay triangulation of all points and computes locally a partial view of this triangulation. This approach prevents memory limitations by never materializing the global triangulation.This efficiency is due to our proposed uncentralized model to represent, manage and locally construct the triangulation corresponding to each tile. The point set is first partitioned into non-overlapping tiles, then we construct within each tile the Delaunay triangulation of the local points and a minimal set of replicated foreign points in order to capture the simplices spanning multiple tiles. Inspired by the star splaying approach for Delaunay triangulation computation/repair, communication is limited to exchanging points of potential Delaunay neighbors across tiles. Therefore, our method is guaranteed to reconstruct, within each tile, a triangulation that contains the star of its local points, as though it were computed within the Delaunay triangulation of all points.The proposed algorithm is implemented with Spark for the scheduling and C++ for the geometric computations. This allows both an optimal scheduling on multiple machines and efficient low-level computation. The results show the efficiency of our algorithm in terms of speedup and strong scaling on a classical Spark configuration with both synthetic and real use case datasets. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The use of consumer grade unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is becoming more and more ubiquitous in photogrammetric applications. A large proportion of consumer grade UAVs are equipped with CMOS image sensor and rolling shutter. When imaging with a rolling shutter camera, the image sensor is exposed line by line, which can introduce additional distortions in image space since the UAV navigates at a relatively high speed during aerial acquisitions. In this paper, we propose (1) an approach to calibrate the readout time of rolling shutter camera, (2) a two-step method to correct the image distortion introduced by this effect. The two-step method makes assumption that during exposure, the change of camera orientation is negligible with respect to the change of camera position, which is often the case when camera is fixed on a stabilized mount. Firstly, the camera velocity is estimated from the results of an initial bundle block adjustment; then, one camera pose per scan-line of the image sensor is recovered and image observations are corrected. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, four datasets of block and corridor configurations are acquired with the DJI Mavic 2 Pro and its original Hasselbald L1D-20c camera. The proposed method is implemented in MicMac, a free, open-source photogrammetric software; comparisons are carried out with other two mainstream software, AgiSoft MetaShape and Pix4D, which also have the functionality of rolling shutter effect correction. For block configuration datasets, the three software give comparable results. AgiSoft Metashape and Pix4D are sensitive to the flight configuration and encounter difficulties when processing datasets in corridor configurations. The proposed method shows good robustness both in block and corridor configurations, and is the only method that works in corridor configuration. After the application of the rolling shutter effect correction, the 3D accuracy is improved by 30–60% in block configuration and 15–25% in corridor configuration. A further improvement can be expected if a precise dating of image is available or if the camera positions can be directly extracted from GNSS data. © 2019},

	abstract = {In this article, we analyze the possibility to improve the classification of crops in an irrigated area of northern Morocco based on the combination of the multi-temporal data of two satellites (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) with the inclusion of nine indices. The area concerned (Loukkos), in addition to its strategic position, is characterized by a Mediterranean climate with a strong ecological value. It presents an intense agricultural activity with a great diversity of cultures whose functioning could be affected by climate change. To quantify water requirements, we used the series of satellite images acquired during 09/2017 to 08/2018. Maps produced for three classification levels illustrate our approach. The study showed that the 10 optical channels, at 10 and 20 m spatial resolution, of the data acquired by Sentinel-2 provide good performance, with a kappa index > 85% for all (sub)classes and an overall accuracy > 86%. These performances are superior to those obtained with radar data acquired by Sentinel-1, with F-score deviations of 9% lower on average, and up to 29% (on cork oak/SSC level). Neither the addition of optical radiometric indices, nor the optical and radar combination data provide a significant improvement in performance obtained with Sentinel-2 data. In order to exploit the data obtained, future work would focus on studying the temporal profiles of each type of crop. © 2020 Soc. Francaise de Photogrammetrie et de Teledetection.

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are increasingly used for topographic mapping. The camera calibration for UAV image blocks can be performed a priori or during the bundle block adjustment (self-calibration). For an area of interest with flat scene and corridor configuration, the focal length of camera is highly correlated with the height of the camera. Furthermore, systematic errors of camera calibration accumulate on the longer dimension and cause deformation. Therefore, special precautions must be taken when estimating camera calibration parameters. In order to better investigate the impact of camera calibration errors, a synthetic, error-free aerial image block is generated to simulate several issues of interest. Firstly, the erroneous focal length in the case of camera pre-calibration is studied. Nadir images are not able to prevent camera poses from drifting to compensate for the erroneous focal length, whereas the inclusion of oblique images brings significant improvement. Secondly, the case where the focal length varies gradually (e.g., when the camera subject to temperature changes) is investigated. The neglect of this phenomenon can substantially degrade the 3D measurement accuracy. Different flight configurations and flight orders are analyzed, the combination of oblique and nadir images shows better performance. At last, the rolling shutter effect is investigated. The influence of camera rotationalmotion on the final accuracy is negligible compared to that of the translationalmotion. The acquisition configurations investigated are not able to mitigate the degradation introduced by the rolling shutter effect. Other solutions such as correcting image measurements or including camera motion parameters in the bundle block adjustment should be exploited. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This manuscript identifies and documents unsolved problems and research challenges in the extended reality (XR) domain (i.e., virtual (VR), augmented (AR), and mixed reality (MR)). The manuscript is structured to include technology, design, and human factor perspectives. The text is visualization/display-focused, that is, other modalities such as audio, haptic, smell, and touch, while important for XR, are beyond the scope of this paper. We further narrow our focus to mainly geospatial research, with necessary deviations to other domains where these technologies are widely researched. The main objective of the study is to provide an overview of broader research challenges and directions in XR, especially in spatial sciences. Aside from the research challenges identified based on a comprehensive literature review, we provide case studies with original results from our own studies in each section as examples to demonstrate the relevance of the challenges in the current research. We believe that this paper will be of relevance to anyone who has scientific interest in extended reality, and/or uses these systems in their research. © 2020 by the authors.

Landmarks near to a route or routes passing near to some landmarks may help in the context of mountain rescue. Therefore, it is necessary to identify relevant data sources and to describe their characteristics. In this paper, we set out to explore the potential of crowdsourced data in order to be considered such as data sources in the context of mountain rescue. Thus, our aim is to study the content of different sources to have a better knowledge on how landmarks and routes are mapped, to demonstrate the complementarity of crowdsourced data with respect with authoritative data, and to study the feasibility of defining links between routes and landmarks. The proposed method used integration techniques such as map matching, route construction and data matching. Among the results, the large number of non-matched features proves the richness of crowdsourced data. The matching results generate new semantic rules for both type of landmarks and geometries of route. © 2019 International Cartographic Association.},

	abstract = {The automatic generation of three-dimensional (3D) building models from geospatial data is now a standard procedure. An abundance of literature covers the last two decades, and several solutions are now available. However, urban areas are very complex environments. Inevitably, practitioners still have to visually assess, at a city-scale, the correctness of these models and detect frequent reconstruction errors. Such a process relies on experts and is highly time-consuming, with approximately two hours/km2 per expert. This work proposes an approach for automatically evaluating the quality of 3D building models. Potential errors are compiled in a novel hierarchical and versatile taxonomy. This allows, for the first time, to disentangle fidelity and modeling errors, whatever the level of details of the modeled buildings. The quality of models is predicted using the geometric properties of buildings and, when available, Very High Resolution images and Digital Surface Models. A baseline of handcrafted, yet generic, features is fed into a Random Forest classifier. Both multiclass and multilabel cases are considered: Due to the interdependence between classes of errors, it is possible to retrieve all errors at the same time while simply predicting correct and erroneous buildings. The proposed framework was tested on three distinct urban areas in France with more than 3000 buildings. 80%-99% F-score values are attained for the most frequent errors. For scalability purposes, the impact of the urban area composition on the error prediction was also studied, in terms of transferability, generalization, and representativeness of the classifiers. It showed the necessity of multimodal remote sensing data and mixing training samples from various cities to ensure a stability of the detection ratios, even with very limited training set sizes. © 2019 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.},

Crisis managers must plan interventions very quickly to facilitate the arrival of the first emergency. In a crisis unit, experts visualize heterogeneous visual representations of spatio-temporal information, in order to facilitate decision-making, based on various types of screens, i.e. laptops, tablets, or wall screens. Visualizing all this information at the same time on the same interface would lead to cognitive overload. In this paper, we assume that it could be of interest to provide innovative co-visualization models and tools, to bring hazard, geospatial and climate information together, in a shared interface. We propose to explore spatial and temporal multiplexing tools within a dedicated geovisualization environment, in order to help expert decision-making.

	abstract = {This paper presents a new method for improving the geometric accuracy of photogrammetric reconstruction by modeling and correcting the thermal effect on camera image sensor. The objective is to verify that when the temperature of image sensor varies during the acquisition, image deformation induced by the temperature change is quantifiable, modelisable and correctable. A temperature sensor integrated in the camera enables the measurement of image sensor temperature at exposure. It is therefore natural and appropriate to take this effect into account and to finally model and correct it after a calibration step. Nowadays, in cartography applications performed with UAV, the frame rate of acquisitions is continuously increasing. A high frame rate over a long acquisition time can result in an important temperature increase of the image sensor and thus introduces image deformations. The correction of the above-mentioned effect can improve the measurement accuracy. We present three methods to calibrate the thermal effect and experiments on two datasets are carried out to verify the improvement in terms of the photogrammetric accuracy. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Tactile maps are created manually and printed by specialists, and it takes a large amount of time to create a new one, which prevents using them on demand for everyday use. As a consequence, researchers and cartographers try to automate this creation process, but the existing automated derivation processes do not include generalization or advanced stylization steps, which limits their effectiveness. This paper reports first experiments to include such complex automated cartography processes to provide on-demand tactile maps for visually impaired people. These first experiments were more intended to raise real research issues than solve them, and the paper discusses these issues in a research agenda to achieve automatically derived tactile maps. © 2018 International Cartographic Association.},

Based on the expertise gained from the TropiScat-12 campaigns, the presented experiments also consist in the acquisition of dense time series using a Vector Network Analyser (VNA) connected to several antennas, herein dedicated to L and C-band data. Likewise, this experiment benefit from auxiliary measurements (meteorological and in-situ data) in order to better understand the processes behind temporal decorrelation, which remains a key issue for future repeat-pass, tandem or geostationary missions. Our first results highlight the importance of the acquisition time during the day, and also rise the challenge on how to disentangle the combined effects of water content variations and wind induced displacements driven by solar convection. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A time series issued from modern synthetic aperture radar satellite imaging sensors is a huge dataset composed by many hundreds of million pixels when observing large-scale earth structures such as big forests or glaciers. A concise monitoring of these large scale structures for anomaly spotting thus requires loading and analyzing huge spatio/polarimetric multi-temporal image series. The contributions of the present paper for the sake of parsimonious analysis of such huge datasets are associated with a framework having two main processing stages. The first stage is the derivation of an index called geometric multi-wavelet total variation for fast and robust anomaly spotting. This index is useful for identifying significant abnormal patterns appearing as geo-spatial non-stationarities in multi-wavelet total variation map. The second stage consists in the proposal of a concise asymmetric multi-date change information matrix on regions associated with significant multi-wavelet total variations. This stage is necessary for a fine characterization of change impacts on existing geo-spatial structures. Experimental tests based on Sentinel-1 data show relevant results on a wide Amazonian forest surrounding the Franco-Brazilian Oyapock Bridge. © 2018 ISIF},

	abstract = {Spatial analysis and pattern recognition with vector spatial data is particularly useful to enrich raw data. In road networks, for instance, there are many patterns and structures that are implicit with only road line features, among which highway interchange appeared very complex to recognize with vector-based techniques. The goal is to find the roads that belong to an interchange, such as the slip roads and the highway roads connected to the slip roads. To go further than state-of-the-art vector-based techniques, this article proposes to use raster-based deep learning techniques to recognize highway interchanges. The contribution of this work is to study how to optimally convert vector data into small images suitable for state-of-the-art deep learning models. Image classification with a convolutional neural network (i.e., is there an interchange in this image or not?) and image segmentation with a u-net (i.e., find the pixels that cover the interchange) are experimented and give better results than existing vector-based techniques in this specific use case (99.5% against 74%). © 2020 ACM.},

This evolution first targets to better fit such a process to the currents requirements and expectations of the ISPRS community. Secondly, it aims to provide unified guidelines for the different steps of the process. Under the aegis of the 2020 Congress Director and ISAC (International Science Advisory Committee) chair, several discussions were held in-between September 2017 and June 2018 with ISAC members, Technical Commission Presidents (TCP), council members, 2016 and 2020 Congress Programme Chairs. This document serves as a unique transparent basis that applies for all kinds of ISPRS events (from Congress and Geospatial Week to smaller workshops), and all categories of people that are bound to be involved in the evaluation process of scientific contributions (authors, reviewers, TCPs, &hellip;). It also specifies the evaluation criteria for the works submitted to ISPRS events, both for full papers and abstracts. Subsequently, it helps authors to improve the content and shape of their contributions. Eventually, this paper is targeted to help new chairs to smoothly prepare their future event.

	abstract = {Among cartographic generalisation problems, the generalisation of sinuous bends in mountain roads has always been a popular one due to its difficulty. Recent research showed the potential of deep learning techniques to overcome some remaining research problems regarding the automation of cartographic generalisation. This paper explores this potential on the popular mountain road generalisation problem, which requires smoothing the road, enlarging the bend summits, and schematising the bend series by removing some of the bends. We modelled the mountain road generalisation as a deep learning problem by generating an image from input vector road data, and tried to generate it as an output of the model a new image of the generalised roads. Similarly to previous studies on building generalisation, we used a U-Net architecture to generate the generalised image from the ungeneralised image. The deep learning model was trained and evaluated on a dataset composed of roads in the Alps extracted from IGN (the French national mapping agency) maps at 1:250,000 (output) and 1:25,000 (input) scale. The results are encouraging as the output image looks like a generalised version of the roads and the accuracy of pixel segmentation is around 65%. The model learns how to smooth the output roads, and that it needs to displace and enlarge symbols but does not always correctly achieve these operations. This article shows the ability of deep learning to understand and manage the geographic information for generalisation, but also highlights challenges to come. © 2020 by the authors.},

In particular, large-scale control of agricultural parcels is an issue of major political and economic importance. In this regard, hybrid convolutional-recurrent neural architectures have shown promising results for the automated classification of satellite image time series. We propose an alternative approach in which the convolutional layers are advantageously replaced with encoders operating on unordered sets of pixels to exploit the typically coarse resolution of publicly available satellite images. We also propose to extract temporal features using a bespoke neural architecture based on self-attention instead of recurrent networks. We demonstrate experimentally that our method not only outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision, but also significantly decreases processing time and memory requirements. Lastly, we release a large open-access annotated dataset as a benchmark for future work on satellite image time series. © 2020 IEEE},

	abstract = {Very high spatial resolution (VHR) multispectral imagery enables a fine delineation of objects and a possible use of texture information. Other sensors provide a lower spatial resolution but an enhanced spectral or temporal information, permitting one to consider richer land cover semantics. So as to benefit from the complementary characteristics of these multimodal sources, a decision late fusion scheme is proposed. This makes it possible to benefit from the full capacities of each sensor, while dealing with both semantic and spatial uncertainties. The different remote-sensing modalities are first classified independently. Separate class membership maps are calculated and then merged at the pixel level, using decision fusion rules. A final label map is obtained from a global regularization scheme in order to deal with spatial uncertainties while conserving the contrasts from the initial images. It relies on a probabilistic graphical model involving a fit-to-data term related to merged class membership measures and an image-based contrast-sensitive regularization term. Conflict between sources can also be integrated into this scheme. Two experimental cases are presented. In the first case one considers the fusion of VHR multispectral imagery with lower spatial resolution hyperspectral imagery for fine-grained land cover classification problem in dense urban areas. In the second case one uses SPOT 6/7 satellite imagery and Sentinel-2 time series to extract urban area footprints through a two-step process: classifications are first merged in order to detect building objects, from which a urban area prior probability is derived and eventually merged to Sentinel-2 classification output for urban footprint detection. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Some machine learning approaches have been proposed in the past to train automatic road network map inference, and recently this approach has been successfully extended to infer road attributes as well, such as speed limitation or number of lanes. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting traffic signals from a set of vehicle speed profiles, under a classification perspective. Each data instance is a speed versus distance plot depicting over a hundred profiles on a 100-m-long road span. We proposed three different ways of deriving features: The first one relies on the raw speed measurements; the second one uses image recognition techniques; and the third one is based on functional data analysis. We input them into most commonly used classification algorithms, and a comparative analysis demonstrated that a functional description of speed profiles with wavelet transforms seems to outperform the other approaches with most of the tested classifiers. It also highlighted that random forests yield an accurate detection of traffic signals, regardless of the chosen feature extraction method, while keeping a remarkably low confusion rate with stop signs. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are increasingly used for topographic mapping. The camera calibration for UAV image blocks can be performed a priori or during the bundle block adjustment (self-calibration). For an area of interest with flat, corridor configuration, the focal length of camera is highly correlated with the height of camera. Furthermore, systematic errors of camera calibration accumulate on the longer dimension and cause deformation. Therefore, special precautions must be taken when estimating camera calibration parameters. In this paper, a simulated, error-free aerial image block is generated. error is then added on camera calibration and given as initial solution to bundle block adjustment. Depending on the nature of the error and the investigation purpose, camera calibration parameters are either fixed or re-estimated during the bundle block adjustment. The objective is to investigate how certain errors in the camera calibration impact the accuracy of 3D measurement without the influence of other errors. All experiments are carried out with Fraser camera calibration model being employed. When adopting a proper flight configuration, an error on focal length for the initial camera calibration can be corrected almost entirely during bundle block adjustment. For the case where an erroneous focal length is given for pre-calibration and not re-estimated, the presence of oblique images limits the drift on camera height hence gives better camera pose estimation. Other than that, the error on focal length when neglecting its variation during the acquisition (e.g., due to camera temperature increase) is also investigated; a bowl effect is observed when one focal length is given in camera pre-calibration to the whole image block. At last, a local error is added in image space to simulate camera flaws; this type of error is more difficult to be corrected with the Fraser camera model and the accuracy of 3D measurement degrades substantially. © Authors 2019.},

Instead of applying some global 3D segmentation method such as PointNet, we propose an end-to-end architecture for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation that efficiently solves the problem as an image processing problem. We first extract high-level 3D features for each point given its 3D neighbors. Then, these features are projected into a 2D multichannel range-image by considering the topology of the sensor. Thanks to these learned features and this projection, we can finally perform the segmentation using a simple U-Net segmentation network, which performs very well while being very efficient. In this way, we can exploit both the 3D nature of the data and the specificity of the LiDAR sensor. This approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin on the KITTI dataset, as our experiments show. Moreover, this approach operates at 24fps on a single GPU. This is above the acquisition rate of common LiDAR sensors which makes it suitable for real-time applications. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {High-spectral-resolution hyperspectral data are acquired by sensors that gather images from hundreds of narrow and contiguous bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. These data offer unique opportunities for characterization and precise land surface recognition in urban areas. So far, few studies have been conducted with these data to automatically detect and estimate areas of photovoltaic panels, which currently constitute an important part of renewable energy systems in urban areas of developed countries. In this paper, two hyperspectral-unmixing-based methods are proposed to detect and to estimate surfaces of photovoltaic panels. These approaches, related to linear spectral unmixing (LSU) techniques, are based on new nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithms that exploit known panel spectra, which makes them partial NMF methods. The first approach, called Grd-Part-NMF, is a gradient-based method, whereas the second one, called Multi-Part-NMF, uses multiplicative update rules. To evaluate the performance of these approaches, experiments are conducted on realistic synthetic and real airborne hyperspectral data acquired over an urban region. For the synthetic data, obtained results show that the proposed methods yield much better overall performance than NMF-unmixing-based methods from the literature. For the real data, the obtained detection and area estimation results are first confirmed by using very high-spatial-resolution ortho-images of the same regions. These results are also compared with those obtained by standard NMF-unmixing-based methods and by a one-class-classification-based approach. This comparison shows that the proposed approaches are superior to those considered from the literature. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {We model surface displacements induced by variations in continental water, atmospheric pressure, and nontidal oceanic loading, derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) for spherical harmonic degrees two and higher. As they are not observable by GRACE, we use at first the degree-1 spherical harmonic coefficients from Swenson et al. (2008, https://doi.org/10.1029/2007JB005338). We compare the predicted displacements with the position time series of 689 globally distributed continuous Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations. While GNSS vertical displacements are well explained by the model at a global scale, horizontal displacements are systematically underpredicted and out of phase with GNSS station position time series. We then reestimate the degree 1 deformation field from a comparison between our GRACE-derived model, with no a priori degree 1 loads, and the GNSS observations. We show that this approach reconciles GRACE-derived loading displacements and GNSS station position time series at a global scale, particularly in the horizontal components. Assuming that they reflect surface loading deformation only, our degree-1 estimates can be translated into geocenter motion time series. We also address and assess the impact of systematic errors in GNSS station position time series at the Global Positioning System (GPS) draconitic period and its harmonics on the comparison between GNSS and GRACE-derived annual displacements. Our results confirm that surface mass redistributions observed by GRACE, combined with an elastic spherical and layered Earth model, can be used to provide first-order corrections for loading deformation observed in both horizontal and vertical components of GNSS station position time series. ©2018.

	abstract = {Fusion of very high spatial resolution multispectral (VHR) images with time series of lower spatial resolution images with more spectral bands can improve land cover classification, combining geometric and semantic advantages of both sources, respectively. This study presents a strategy to extract the urban footprint using decision-level fusion of individual classifications on Sentinel-2 and SPOT 6/7 satellite images. First, both sources are classified separately in five classes, using state-of-the-art supervised Random Forest classification and Convolutional Neural Networks. The two results are then merged in order to extract individual buildings with the highest spatial precision conceivable. Secondly, detected buildings are merged again with the Sentinel-2 classification so as to extract the artificialized areas; the building labels from the regularization step are dilated in order to connect the building objects; a binary classification is derived from the original Sentinel-2 classification before being reintroduced in a fusion and contrast sensitive regularization process so as to eventually retrieve the urban footprint. Results show well the complementary between both data sources as well as the relevance of the late fusion stategy. © 2022 Authors. All rights reserved.},

The cartography from spaceborne images allows the estimation of land use over large areas. The Sentinel-1 mission consists of the orbiting of two satellites (Sentinel-1A [S1A] and 1B [S1B]) carrying a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor. This chapter provides a brief review of the main classification methods used in remote sensing, and details the pre-processing of Sentinel-1 radar data required for use in classification algorithms. These classifications aim to map main land use entities. The processing presented is developed in Python language, based on the Orfeo Toolbox (OTB) algorithms, and integrated into quantum geographic information system (QGIS) software, in order to make them accessible to non-specialists in radar data. A classification algorithm aims to generate, from one or more remote sensing images, an image containing different thematic classes.

	abstract = {Understanding how and when far-field continuous motions lead to giant subduction earthquakes remains a challenge. An important limitation comes from an incomplete description of aseismic mass fluxes at depth along plate boundaries. Here we analyse Earth's gravity field variations derived from GRACE satellite data in a wide space-time domain surrounding the M w 9.0 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. We show that this earthquake is the extreme expression of initially silent deformation migrating from depth to the surface across the entire subduction system. Our analysis indeed reveals large-scale gravity and mass changes throughout three tectonic plates and connected slabs, starting a few months before March 2011. Before the Tohoku-Oki earthquake rupture, the gravity variations can be explained by aseismic extension of the Pacific plate slab at mid-upper mantle depth, concomitant with increasing seismicity in the shallower slab. For more than two years after the rupture, the deformation propagated far into the Pacific and Philippine Sea plate interiors, suggesting that subduction accelerated along 2,000 km of the plate boundaries in March 2011. This gravitational image of the earthquake's long-term dynamics provides unique information on deep and crustal processes over intermediate timescales, which could be used in seismic hazard assessment. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

We compute Green's functions for surface displacements for a purely elastic spherical reference Earth model and for viscoelastic Earth models. We show that a range of transient viscoelastic rheologies derived to explain the early phase of postseismic deformation may induce a detectable effect on the phase and amplitude of horizontal displacements induced by seasonal loading at long wavelengths (1,300–4,000 km). By comparing predicted and observed seasonal horizontal motion, we conclude that transient asthenospheric viscosity cannot be lower than 5 × 1017 Pa.s, suggesting that low values of transient asthenospheric viscosities reported in some postseismic studies cannot hold for the seasonal deformation global average. ©2018.

	abstract = {In this work, we propose a new approach to automatically detect ruptures in spatial relationships in video sequences, based on low-level primitives, in unsupervised manner. The spatial relationships between two objects of interest are modeled using angle and distance histograms as examples. The evolution of the spatial relationships during time is estimated from the distances between two successive angle or distance histograms and then considered as a temporal signal. The evolution of a spatial relationship is modeled by a linear Gaussian model. Then, two hypotheses “without change” and “with change” are considered, and a log-likelihood ratio is computed. The distribution of the log-likelihood ratio, given that H0 is true, is estimated and used to compute the p value. The comparison of this p value to a significance level α, expressing the probability of false alarms, allows us to detect significant ruptures in spatial relationships during time. In addition, this approach is generalized to detect multiple object events such as merging, splitting, and other events that contain ruptures in their spatial relationships evolution. This work shows that the description of spatial relationships across time is a promising step toward event detection. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

This is called Visual Based Localization (VBL). Due to numerous data types that can be collected from a scene, VBL encompasses a large amount of different methods. This paper presents a survey about recent methods that localize a visual acquisition system according to a known environment. We start by categorizing VBL methods into two distinct families: indirect and direct localization systems. As the localization environment is almost always dynamic, we pay special attention to methods designed to handle appearances changes occurring in a scene. Thereafter, we highlight methods exploiting heterogeneous types of data. Finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion on promising trends that could permit to a localization system to reach high precision pose estimation within an area as large as possible. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Images from archival aerial photogrammetric surveys are a unique and relatively unexplored means to chronicle 3D land-cover changes over the past 100 years. They provide a relatively dense temporal sampling of the territories with very high spatial resolution. Such time series image analysis is a mandatory baseline for a large variety of long-term environmental monitoring studies. The current bottleneck for accurate comparison between epochs is their fine georeferencing step. No fully automatic method has been proposed yet and existing studies are rather limited in terms of area and number of dates. State-of-the art shows that the major challenge is the identification of ground references: cartographic coordinates and their position in the archival images. This task is manually performed, and extremely time-consuming. This paper proposes to use a photogrammetric approach, and states that the 3D information that can be computed is the key to full automation. Its original idea lies in a 2-step approach: (i) the computation of a coarse absolute image orientation; (ii) the use of the coarse Digital Surface Model (DSM) information for automatic absolute image orientation. It only relies on a recent orthoimage+DSM, used as master reference for all epochs. The coarse orthoimage, compared with such a reference, allows the identification of dense ground references and the coarse DSM provides their position in the archival images. Results on two areas and 5 dates show that this method is compatible with long and dense archival aerial image series. Satisfactory planimetric and altimetric accuracies are reported, with variations depending on the ground sampling distance of the images and the location of the Ground Control Points. © 2018 Copernicus GmbH.

No geometric constraints (e.g. surface planarity) or auxiliary data in form of ground control points are required for its operation. Prior to the fusion procedures, the RPC geolocation parameters of all images are improved in a bundle block adjustment routine. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on two VHR (Very High Resolution)-satellite image datasets (Pléiades, WorldView-3) revealing its good performance in reconstructing non-textured areas, repetitive patterns, and surface discontinuities. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, the rapid expansion of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) coupled with the incremental improvements on the existing GPS constellation has continuously increased the robustness of satellite positioning, therefore significantly improving the reliability and the possibilities of a GNSS-based structural health monitoring system. Moreover, thanks to constant evolution, GPS-only receivers have proven to be more and more efficient with relatively simple hardware, provided that they are used in an appropriate workflow such as relative positioning with short baselines. This paper presents an application of a network of cost-effective GPS receivers as a part of a monitoring system. Monitoring data are acquired from a network of a dozen of GPS “Geocube” stations installed on a suspended bridge, the Brotonne Bridge, in France. One main objective of this network is to be able to detect some changes in bridge behaviour. Data from GPS sensor is analysed and correlated with traditional data, such as piers temperature. This study validates that a GPS sensor network can provide useful and reliable data for structural monitoring. © 2018 NDT.net. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Due to the increasing number of low-cost sensors, widely accessible on the market, and because of the supposed granted correctness of the semi-automatic workflow for 3D reconstruction, highly implemented in the recent commercial software, more and more users operate nowadays without following the rigorousness of classical photogrammetric methods. This behaviour often naively leads to 3D products that lacks metric quality assessment. This paper proposes and analyses an approach that gives the users the possibility to preserve the trustworthiness of the metric information inherent in the 3D model, without sacrificing the automation offered by modern photogrammetry software. At the beginning, the importance of Data Quality Assessment is outlined, together with some recall of photogrammetry best practices. With the purpose of guiding the user through a correct pipeline for a certified 3D model reconstruction, an operative workflow is proposed, focusing on the first part of the object reconstruction steps (tie-points extraction, camera calibration, and relative orientation). A new GUI (Graphical User Interface) developed for the open source MicMac suite is then presented, and a sample dataset is used for the evaluation of the photogrammetric block orientation using statistically obtained quality descriptors. The results and the future directions are then presented and discussed. © Authors 2018.},

	abstract = {The sensitivity of the radar signal to the seasonal dynamics in the Sahel region is a considerable asset for monitoring surface parameters including soil moisture. Given the sensitivity of the radar signal to vegetation mass production, roughness and soil moisture, the main problem has been to estimate the contribution of these three parameters to the signal. This study aims to circumvent this problem by combining radar with optical data. The DMP (Dry Mater Product) extracted from SPOT data allowed to estimate vegetation mass production. Surface roughness was estimated from radar data during the dry season. Because during the dry season, radar signal is only conditioned by soil roughness in this region a Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) was used: it consists in a microwave scattering model of layered vegetation based on the first-order solution of the radiative transfer equation and it accounts for multiple scattering within the canopy, surface roughness of the soil, and the interaction between canopy surface and soil. This model was designed to account for the branch size distribution, leaf orientation distribution, and branch orientation distribution for each size. In this study, the RTM has been calibrated with ESCAT (European Radar Satellite Scatterometer) data, and has been used in order to estimate soil moisture. The results obtained have allowed to track the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture on the one hand, and on the other hand the influence of geology and morphopedology on the spatial dynamics of the soil moisture variability. These results are promising despite the fact that the inversed RTM often faces difficulties to interpret the signal for saturated soils, giving an aberrant value of soil moisture more often than not. © 2017 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences},

In this paper, we present a fully automatic framework for 3D high quality large scale urban texture mapping using oriented images and LiDAR scans acquired by a terrestrial Mobile Mapping System (MMS). First, the acquired points and images are sliced into temporal chunks ensuring a reasonable size and time consistency between geometry (points) and photometry (images). Then, a simple, fast and scalable 3D surface reconstruction relying on the sensor space topology is performed on each chunk after an isotropic sampling of the point cloud obtained from the raw LiDAR scans. Finally, the algorithm proposed in (Waechter et al., 2014) is adapted to texture the reconstructed surface with the images acquired simultaneously, ensuring a high quality texture with no seams and global color adjustment. We evaluate our full pipeline on a dataset of 17 km of acquisition in Rouen, France resulting in nearly 2 billion points and 40000 full HD images. We are able to reconstruct and texture the whole acquisition in less than 30 computing hours, the entire process being highly parallel as each chunk can be processed independently in a separate thread or computer. © 2018 Copernicus GmbH.

They have been digitized in many countries so far and are even available for free. However, existing studies are rather limited in terms of area and number of dates since no fully automatic method has been proposed yet to finely georeference archival images, the major challenge being the identification of a sufficient amount of ground references: cartographic coordinates and their position in the archival images. This paper adresses this issue and proposes a photogrammetric 2-step approach. First, a coarse absolute image orientation is computed out of basic metadata provided with the archives. Then, an automatic extraction of ground control points is performed. These points are used in order to refine orientation. Such a step only relies on a recent orthoimage+Digital Surface Model, used as reference for all epochs. The coarse orthoimage derived out of coarsely oriented archival images is compared with such a reference, and enables the identification of dense ground references. At the end, a new bundle adjustment using these ground control points is calculated. Our experiments on two distinct areas (one urban and oen forested) show the validity of our approach and the satisfactory quality of the results. They already allow the exploitation of the images for various thematical use cases. © 2022 Authors. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Time measured by an ideal clock crucially depends on the gravitational potential and velocity of the clock according to general relativity. Technological advances in manufacturing high-precision atomic clocks have rapidly improved their accuracy and stability over the last decade that approached the level of 10 − 18. This notable achievement along with the direct sensitivity of clocks to the strength of the gravitational field make them practically important for various geodetic applications that are addressed in the present paper. Based on a fully relativistic description of the background gravitational physics, we discuss the impact of those highly-precise clocks on the realization of reference frames and time scales used in geodesy. We discuss the current definitions of basic geodetic concepts and come to the conclusion that the advances in clocks and other metrological technologies will soon require the re-definition of time scales or, at least, clarification to ensure their continuity and consistent use in practice. The relative frequency shift between two clocks is directly related to the difference in the values of the gravity potential at the points of clock’s localization. According to general relativity the relative accuracy of clocks in 10 − 18 is equivalent to measuring the gravitational red shift effect between two clocks with the height difference amounting to 1 cm. This makes the clocks an indispensable tool in high-precision geodesy in addition to laser ranging and space geodetic techniques. We show how clock measurements can provide geopotential numbers for the realization of gravity-field-related height systems and can resolve discrepancies in classically-determined height systems as well as between national height systems. Another application of clocks is the direct use of observed potential differences for the improved recovery of regional gravity field solutions. Finally, clock measurements for space-borne gravimetry are analyzed along with closely-related deficiencies of this method like an extra-ordinary knowledge of the spacecraft velocity, etc. For all these applications besides the near-future prospects, we also discuss the challenges that are related to using those novel clock data in geodesy. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

The results show that this method provides accurate results in terms of localization and performs advantageously compared to the OpenStreetMap database in exhaustivity. Among many potential applications, the output predictions may be used as a prior map and/or combined with other sources of data to guide autonomous vehicles. © Yann Méneroux, Hiroshi Kanasugi, Guillaume Saint Pierre, Arnaud Le Guilcher, Sébastien Mustière, Ryosuke Shibasaki, and Yugo Kato.},

	abstract = {Characterizing active faults and quantifying their activity are major concerns in Taiwan, especially following the major Chichi earthquake on 21 September 1999. Among the targets that still remain poorly understood in terms of active tectonics are the Hengchun and Kenting faults (Southern Taiwan). From a geodynamic point of view, the faults affect the outcropping top of the Manila accretionary prism of the Manila subduction zone that runs from Luzon (northern Philippines) to Taiwan. In order to better locate and quantify the location and quantify the activity of the Hengchun Fault, we start from existing geological maps, which we update thanks to the use of two products derived from unmanned aircraft system acquisitions: (1) a very high precision (&lt;g50gcm) and resolution (&lt;g10gcm) digital surface model (DSM) and (2) a georeferenced aerial photograph mosaic of the studied area. Moreover, the superimposition of the resulting structural sketch map with new Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) results obtained from PALSAR ALOS images, validated by Global Positioning System (GPS) and leveling data, allows the characterization and quantification of the surface displacements during the monitoring period (2007-2011). We confirm herein the geometry, characterization and quantification of the active Hengchun Fault deformation, which acts as an active left-lateral transpressive fault. As the Hengchun ridge was the location of one of the last major earthquakes in Taiwan (26 December 2006, depth: 44gkm, ML Combining double low line g7.0), Hengchun Peninsula active tectonics must be better constrained in order if possible to prevent major destructions in the near future. © Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {The latest developments in the field of digital humanities have increasingly enabled the construction of large data sets which can be easily accessed and used. These data sets often contain indirect spatial information, such as historical addresses. Historical geocoding is the process of transforming indirect spatial information into direct locations which can be placed on a map, thus allowing for spatial analysis and cross-referencing. There are many geocoders that work efficiently for current addresses. However, these do not tackle temporal information, and usually follow a strict hierarchy (country, city, street, house number, etc.) which is difficult — if not impossible — to use with historical data. Historical data is filled with uncertainty (pertaining to temporal, textual, and positional accuracy, as well as to the reliability of historical sources) which can neither be ignored nor entirely resolved. Our open source, open data, and extensible solution for geocoding is based on extracting a large number of simple gazetteers composed of geohistorical objects, from historical maps. Geocoding a historical address becomes the process of finding one or several geohistorical objects in the gazetteers which best match the historical address searched by the user. The matching criteria are customisable, weighted, and include several dimensions (fuzzy string, fuzzy temporal, level of detail, positional accuracy). Since our goal is to facilitate historical work, we also put forward web-based user interfaces which help geocode (one address or batch mode) and display results over current or historical maps. Geocoded results can then be checked and edited collaboratively (no source is modified). The system was tested on the city of Paris, France, for the 19th and 20th centuries. It showed high response rates and worked quickly enough to be used interactively. © 2018 by the authors.},

In this paper, we propose a method to assess the influence of local ‘Right to Build’ regulations on constructibility. Our method is based on an optimization algorithm that generates building configurations. This method requires a geographic model that supports the formalization of the Right to Build regulation in order to check if a building respects it. The proposed approach relies on the trans-dimensional simulated annealing optimization method, which produces building configurations composed of a set of parametric objects (boxes in our implementation). Our proposition is released as the SimPLU3D Open-Source project (http://ignf.github.io/simplu3D/). In this paper, we present some tests and results based on this implementation and a use related to the assistance to ‘Right to Build’ designers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

In this context, CNES initiated an assessment study called GRICE (GRadiométrie à Interféromètres quantiques Corrélés pour l'Espace) in order to evaluate the impact of cold atom technologies to space geodesy and to the end users of the geodetic data. In this paper, we present a specific mission scenario for gravity field mapping based on a twin satellite concept. The mission uses a constellation of two satellites each equipped with a cold atom accelerometer. A laser link measures the distance between the two satellites and couples these two instruments in order to produce a correlated differential acceleration measurement. The main parameters, determining the performances of the payload, have been investigated. In addition, a preliminary study of mass, consumption and volume has been conducted to ensure the onboard feasibility of these instruments. A general study of the satellite architecture, including all the subsystems, has also been realized and is presented here. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.},

	abstract = {The recent initiatives to digitize cultural heritage resources and publish them on the Web have renewed interest in historical maps for the diachronic analysis of territories in GIS applications. However, such analyses should not be done without a good understanding of the possibilities and limitations of geographical information provided by historical maps, i.e. their quality. One of the major concerns regarding historical maps quality is their positional planimetric accuracy which highly depends on survey techniques used at the time. As these techniques are not always thoroughly known and as ground truth is most of the time not sufficiently available, direct absolute evaluation approaches have been proposed to assess historical maps positional planimetric accuracy. In this article, we follow the intuition that the most widely adopted georeferencing-based approach for assessing the positional planimetric accuracy of historical maps can be adapted to provide an evaluation of the error caused by the survey process in cases like Paris atlases where the georeferencing transformation can be estimated with ground control points based on geodetic features and where the projection of the map can be approximated by a well known projected coordinate reference system. We apply this tuned approach on the Verniquet atlas and evaluate the validity of our hypothesis about projection approximation. © 2018 ACM.},

Our main goal is to produce a reconstruction of a scene that is adapted to the local geometry of objects. Our method uses the inherent topology of the MLS sensor to define a spatial adjacency relationship between points. We then investigate each possible connexion between adjacent points and filter them by searching collinear structures in the scene, or structures perpendicular to the laser beams. Next, we create triangles for each triplet of self-connected edges. Last, we improve this method with a regularization based on the co-planarity of triangles and collinearity of remaining edges. We compare our results to a naive simplicial complexes reconstruction based on edge length. © 2018 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this study, 10 Corner Reflectors (CR) are exploited with a Sentinel-1 SAR image time series for glacier and moraine displacement measurement in the Chamonix-Mont-Blanc valley. The Radar-Cross Sections of 3 different CRs are measured in an anechoic chamber. The visibility in SAR images of 8 CRs installed over the Argentière glacier and the surrounding moraine are investigated. The amplitude stability and the phase error of each CR are also estimated. A precise tracking of one CR has allowed to measure the displacement of the Argentière glacier. Furthermore, a Persistent Scatter Interferometry study has been initiated to estimate the moraine instability. © VDE VERLAG GMBH Â Berlin Â Offenbach.},

	abstract = {Fusion of very high spatial resolution multispectral (VHR) images with time series of lower spatial resolution images with more spectral bands can improve land cover classification, combining geometric and semantic advantages of both sources, respectively. This study presents a strategy to extract the urban footprint using decision-level fusion of individual classifications on Sentinel-2 and SPOT 6/7 satellite images. First, both sources are classified separately in five classes, using state-of-the-art supervised Random Forest classification and Convolutional Neural Networks. The two results are then merged in order to extract individual buildings with the highest spatial precision conceivable. Secondly, detected buildings are merged again with the Sentinel-2 classification so as to extract the artificialized areas; the building labels from the regularization step are dilated in order to connect the building objects; a binary classification is derived from the original Sentinel-2 classification before being reintroduced in a fusion and contrast sensitive regularization process so as to eventually retrieve the urban footprint. Results show well the complementary between both data sources as well as the relevance of the late fusion stategy. © 2018 Soc. Francaise de Photogrammetrie et de Teledetection.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel methodology for lidar point cloud processing that takes advantage of the implicit topology of various lidar sensors to derive 2D images from the point cloud while bringing spatial structure to each point. The interest of such a methodology is then proved by addressing the problems of segmentation and disocclusion of mobile objects in 3D lidar scenes acquired using street-based Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS). Most of the existing lines of research tackle those problems directly in the 3D space. This work promotes an alternative approach by using this image representation of the 3D point cloud, taking advantage of the fact that theproblem of disocclusion has been intensively studied in the 2D image processing community over the past decade. Using the image derived from the sensor data by exploiting the sensor topology, a semi-automatic segmentation procedure based on depth histograms is presented. Then, a variational image inpainting technique is introduced to reconstruct the areas that are occluded by objects. Experiments and validation on real data prove the effectiveness of this methodology both in terms of accuracy and speed. © 2018 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.},
